            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>If I pretended to compoſe a complete treatiſe upon this ſubject, I ſhould not refuſe thoſe large recruites of reaſons and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, which offer themſelves to ſerve in this cauſe, for God and man, Religion and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Church &amp; Common-wealth, againſt the blaſphemous, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and deſtructive opinion of

But as mine aim, in the firſt diſcourſe, was onely to preſs home thoſe things in writing, which had been agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated between us by word of mouth, (a courſe much to be preferred before verball confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as being freer from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and tergiverſations, leſs ſubject to miſtakes and miſrela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein paralogiſmes are more quickly detected, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies diſcovered, &amp; confuſion avoided.) So my preſent intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely to vindicate that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and together with it, thoſe lights of the Schooles, who were never ſleighted, but where
<pb facs="tcp:169972:3"/> they were not underſtood. How far I have performed it, I leave to the judicious and unpartiall Reader, reſting for mine own part well contented with this, that I have ſatisfied my ſelf.</p>

               <label>TO THE READER.</label> CHriſtian Reader, this enſuing treatiſe was neither penned nor intended for the Preſs, but privately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, that by the ventilation of the queſtion, truth might be cleared from miſtakes. The ſame was <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his deſire at that time, as appeareth by four paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in his Book, <note place="margin">P. 18. 26. 35. &amp; 80.</note> wherein he requeſteth and beſeecheth, that it may be kept private. But either through forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or change of judgment, he hath now cauſed, or permitted it to be printed in England, without either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining my firſt diſcourſe, to which he wrote that anſwer, or ſo much as mentioning this Reply, which he hath had in his hands now theſe eight years. So wide is the date of his letter, in the year 1652. from the truth, and his manner of dealing with me in this particular from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, (if the edition were with his own conſent.) Howſoever here is all that paſſed between us upon this ſubject, without any addition, or the leaſt variation from the originall.</p>
            <p>Concerning the nameleſs Authour of the preface, who takes upon him to hang out an Ivy buſh before this rare piece of ſublimated Stoaciſme, to invite paſſengers to purchaſe it. As I know not who he is, ſo I do not much heed it, nor regard, either his ignorant cenſures, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolicall expreſſions. The Church of England is as much above his detraction, as he is beneath this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let him lick up the ſpittle of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> by himſelf, as his ſervile flatterers did, and proteſt, that it is more ſweet than Nectar; we envie him not, much good may it do him. His very frontiſpiece is a ſufficient confutation of his whole preface, wherein he tells the world as falſly
<pb facs="tcp:169972:5"/> and ignorantly, as confidently, that <hi>all controverſy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Predeſtination, Election, Free-will, Grace, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Reprobation, &amp;c. is fully decided and cleared.</hi> Thus he accuſtometh his pen to run over, beyond all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limits of truth and diſcretion, to let us ſee that his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Theologicall Controverſies is none at all, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what miſerable times we are fallen, when blind men will be the onely judges of colours. <hi>Quid tanto dignum feret hic promiſſor hiatu?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet one thing more, whereof I deſire to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe the Reader. Whereas <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> mentions my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to his Book <hi>De Cive;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> It is true, that ten yeares ſince I gave him about 60. exceptions, the one half of them Politicall, the other half Theologicall, to that Book, and every exception juſtified by a number of reaſons, to which he never yet vouchſafed any anſwer. Nor do I now deſire it, for ſince that, he hath publiſhed his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan: <hi>Monſtrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumen ademptum,</hi> which affords much more matter of exception. And I am informed that there are already two, the one of our own Church, the other a ſtranger, who have ſhaken in pieces the whole Fabrick of his City, that was but builded in the air, and reſolved that huge maſs of his ſeeming Leviathan into a new nothing, and that their labours will ſpeedily be publiſhed. But if this information ſhould not prove true, I will not grudge upon his deſire, God willing, to demonſtrate, that his principles are pernicious, both to Piety and Policy, and deſtructive to all relations of mankind, between Prince and Subject, Father and Child, Maſter and Servant, Husband and Wife; And that they, who maintain them obſtinately, are fitter to live in hollow-trees among wild beaſts, than in any Chriſtian or Politicall Society, ſo God bleſs us.</p>

                  <hi>RIght Honourable, I had once reſolved to anſwer <hi>J. D</hi>'s. objections to my Book <hi>De Cive</hi> in the firſt place, as that which concerns me moſt, and afterwards to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this diſcourſe of Liberty and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which (becauſe I never had uttered my opinion of it) concerned me the leſs. But ſeeing it was both your Lordſhips, and <hi>J. D.</hi>'s. deſire, that I ſhould begin with the latter, I was contented ſo to do. And here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſubmit it to your Lordſhips judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THe firſt day that I did read over <hi>T. H.</hi> his defence of the neceſſity of all things, was <hi>April</hi> 20. 1646. which proceeded not out of any diſreſpect to him; for if all his diſcourſes had been Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical demonſtrations, able not onely to perſwade, but alſo to compell aſſent, all had been one to me, firſt my journey, and afterwards ſome other trifles (which we call buſineſs) having diverted me untill then. And then my occaſions permitting me, and an advertiſement from a friend awakening me, I ſet my ſelf to a ſerious examination of it. We commonly ſee thoſe who delight in Paradoxes, if they have line enough, confute themſelves, and their ſpeculatives, and their practicks familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enterferre one with another. The very firſt words of <hi>T. H.</hi> his defence trip up the heels of his whole cauſe; <hi>I had ones
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169972:6"/> reſolved;</hi> To reſolve praeſuppoſeth delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but what deliberation can there be of that which is inevitably determined by cauſes, without our ſelves, before we do deliberate? can a condemned man deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate whether he ſhould be executed, or not? It is even to as much purpoſe, as for a man to conſult and ponder with himſelf whether he ſhould draw in his Breath, or whether he ſhould increaſe in ſtature. Secondly, <hi>to reſolve</hi> implies a mans dominion over his own actions, and his actuall determination of himſelf; but he who holds an abſolute neceſſity of all things, hath quitted this dominion over himſelf, and (which is worſe) hath quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the ſecond extrinſecal cauſes, in which he makes all his actions to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; one may as well call again Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, as <hi>reſolve,</hi> or newly determine that which is determined to his hand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. I have peruſed this treatiſe, weighed <hi>T. H.</hi> his anſwers, conſidered his reaſons, and conclude that he hath miſſed and miſled the queſtion, that the anſwers are evaſions, that his Arguments are parolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms, that the opinion of abſolute and univerſall neceſſity is but a reſult of ſome groundleſs and ill choſen principles, and that the defect is not in himſelf, but that his cauſe will admit no better defence; and therefore by his favour I am reſolved to adhere to my firſt opinion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169972:7"/> another man reading this diſcourſe with other eyes, judgeth it to be pertinent and well founded; How comes this to paſs? the treatiſe is the ſame, the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our cauſes are the ſame, yet the reſolution is contrary. Do the ſecond cauſes play faſt and looſe? do they neceſſitate me to condemn, and neceſſitate him to maintain? what is it then? the difference muſt be in our ſelves, either in our intellectuals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one ſees clearer then the other, or in our affections, which betray our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and produce an implicite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerence in the one more than in the other. Howſoever it be, the difference is in our ſelves. The outward cauſes alone do not chain me to the one reſolution, nor him to the other reſolution. But <hi>T. H.</hi> may ſay, that our ſeverall and reſpective de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations and affections, are in part the cauſes of our contrary reſolutions, and do concur with the outward cauſes, to make up one totall and adaequate cauſe, to the neceſſary production of this effect. If it be ſo, he hath ſpun a fair thred, to make all this ſtir for ſuch a neceſſity as no man ever denied or doubted of; when all the cauſes have actually determined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then the effect is in being; for though there be a priority in nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cauſe and the effect, yet they are together in time. And the old rule is, <hi>whatſoever is, when it is, is neceſſarily ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169972:7"/> as it is.</hi> This is no abſolute neceſſity, but onely upon ſuppoſition, that a man hath determined his own liberty. When we queſtion whether all occurrences be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, we do not queſtion, whether they be neceſſary when they are, nor whether they be neceſſary <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> after we have reſolved, and finally determined what to do, but whether they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary before they were determined by our ſelves, by or in the praecedent cauſes before our ſelves, or in the exteriour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without ourſelves. It is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true liberty to determine it ſelf, but it is inconſiſtent with true liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be determined by another without it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. H.</hi> ſaith further, <hi>that upon your Lordſhips deſire and mine, he was contented to begin with this diſcourſe of liberty and neceſſity,</hi> that is, to change his former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. If the chain of neceſſity be no ſtronger, but that it may be ſnapped ſo eaſily in ſunder, if his will was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined from without himſelf, but onely by the ſignification of your Lordſhips deſire, and my modeſt intreaty, then we may ſafely conclude, that humane affairs are not alwaies governed by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, that a man is Lord of his own actions, if not in chief, yet in mean, ſubordinate to the Lord Paramount of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and that all things are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169972:8"/> not ſo abſolutely determined in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and precedent cauſes, but that fair intreaties, and morall perſwaſions may work upon a good nature ſo far, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that which otherwiſe had been, and to produce that which otherwiſe had not been. He that can reconcile this with an Antecedent Neceſſity of all things, and a Phyſicall or naturall determination of all cauſes, ſhall be great <hi>Apollo</hi> to me.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>T.

                  <hi>THe Praeface is an handſome one, but it appears even in that, that he hath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken the queſtion; for whereas he ſaies thus, If I be free to write this diſcourſe, I have obteined the cauſe, I deny that to be true, for 'tis not enough to his freedom of writing, that he had not written it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he would himſelf; if he will obtein the cauſe, he muſt prove that before he writ it, it was not neceſſary he ſhould write it afterward. It may be he thinks it all one to ſay I was free to write it, and it was not neceſſary I ſhould write it. But I think otherwiſe; for he is free to do a thing, that may do it if he have the will to do it, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169972:9"/> may forbear if he have the will to forbear, And yet if there be a neceſſity that he ſhall have the will to do it, the action is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to follow. And if there be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that he ſhall have the will to forbear, the forbearing alſo will be neceſſary. The queſtion therefore is not, whether a man be a free agent, that is to ſay, whether he can write or forbear, ſpeak or be ſilent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, but whether the will to write, and the will to forbear, come upon him according to his will, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any thing elſe in his own power.

Whether of us hath miſtaken the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169972:9"/> queſtion, I refer to the judicious Reader. Thus much I will maintain, that, that is no true neceſſity, which he calls neceſſity, nor that liberty which he calls liberty, nor that the queſtion which he makes the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt for liberty, that which he calls li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is no true liberty.</p>
               <p>For the clearing whereof it behooveth us to know the difference between theſe three, <hi>Neceſſity. Spontaneity,</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neceſſity and Spontaneity may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet together, ſo may ſpontaneity and liberty, but reall neceſſity and true liberty can never meet together, ſomethings are neceſſary and not voluntary or ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, ſomethings are both neceſſary and voluntary, ſomethings are voluntary and not free, ſomethings are both voluntary &amp; free; But thoſe things which are truly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary can never be free, and thoſe things which are truly free can never be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Neceſſity conſiſts in an Antecedent determination to one, Spontaneity conſiſts in a conformity of the Appetite, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual or ſenſitive to the object; True liberty conſiſts in the elective power of the rational will; That which is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without my concurrence, may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs agree well enough with my fancy or deſires, and obtein my ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; But that which is determined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my concurrence or conſent, cannot be the object of mine election. I may like that which is inevitably impoſed upon me
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169972:10"/> by another, but if it be inevitably impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon me by extrinſecall cauſes, it is both folly for me to deliberate, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to chooſe, whether I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo it or not. Reaſon is the root, the fountain, the originall of true liberty, which judgeth and repreſenteth to the will, whether this or that be convenient, whether this or that be more convenient. Judge then what a pretty kind of liberty it is which is maintained by <hi>T. H.</hi> ſuch a liberty as is in little Children before they have the uſe of reaſon, before they can conſult or deliberate of any thing. Is not this a Childiſh liberty? and ſuch a liberty as is in brute Beaſts, as Bees and Spiders, which do not learn their faculties as we do our trades, by experience and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; This is a brutiſh liberty, ſuch a liberty as a Bird hath to flie, when her wings are clipped, or to uſe his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, ſuch a liberty as a lame man who hath loſt the uſe of his lims hath to walk; Is not this a ridiculous liberty? Laſtly (which is worſe then all theſe) ſuch a <hi>liberty as a River hath to deſcend down the Channell;</hi> what will he aſcribe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to inanimate Creatures alſo, which have neither reaſon, nor ſpontaneity, nor ſo much as ſenſitive appetite? Such is <hi>T. H.</hi> his liberty.</p>
               <p>His neceſſity is juſt ſuch another, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon ſuppoſition, ariſing from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169972:10"/> concourſe of all the cauſes, including the laſt dictate of the underſtanding in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures. The adaequate cauſe and the effect are together in time, and when all the concurrent cauſes are determined, the effect is determined alſo, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo neceſſary, that it is actually in being; But there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween determining, and being determined; if all the collaterall cauſes concurring to the production of an effect, were antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently determined, what they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity produce, and when they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, then there is no doubt but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is neceſſary. But if theſe cauſes did operate freely, or contingently, if they might have ſuſpended or denied their concurrence, or have concurred after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner, then the effect was not truly and Antecedently neceſſary, but either free or contingent. This will be yet clearer by conſidering his own inſtance of <hi>caſting Ambs-Ace,</hi> though it partake more of contingency then of freedom. Suppoſing the poſiture of the parties hand who did throw the Dice, ſuppoſing the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Table and of the Dice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuppoſing the meaſure of force ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and ſuppoſing all other things which did concur to the production of that caſt, to be the very ſame they were, there is no doubt but in this caſe the caſt is neceſſary. But ſtill this is but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169972:11"/> of ſuppoſition; for if all theſe concurrent cauſes or ſome of them were contingent or free, then the caſt was not abſolutely neceſſary. To begin with the Caſter, He might have denied his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and not have caſt at all; He might have ſuſpended his concurrence, and not have caſt ſo ſoon; He might have doubled or diminiſhed his force in caſting, if it had pleaſed him; He might have thrown the dice into the other table. In all theſe caſes what becomes of his <hi>ambs-ace?</hi> The like uncertainties offer themſelves for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the tables, and for the maker of the dice, and for the keeper of the tables, and for the kind of wood, and I know not how many other circumſtances. In ſuch a maſs of contingencies, it is impoſſible that the effect ſhould be antecedently neceſſary. <hi>T. H.</hi> appeales to every mans experience. I am contented. Let every one reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and he ſhall find no convincing, much leſs conſtreining reaſon, to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him to any one of theſe particular acts more than another, but onely his own will or arbitrary determination. So <hi>T. H.</hi> his neceſſity is no abſolute, no antecedent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall neceſſity, but meerly a neceſſity upon ſuppoſition.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, that which <hi>T. H.</hi> makes the queſtion, is not the queſtion. The queſtion is not, ſaith he, <hi>Whether a man may write if he will, and forbear if he will, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169972:11"/> the will to write or the will to forbear come upon him according to his will, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any thing els in his own power.</hi> Here is a diſtinction without a difference. If his will do not come upon him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, then he is not a free, nor yet ſo much as a voluntary agent, which is <hi>T. H.</hi> his liberty. Certainly all the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the agent is from the freedom of the will. If the will have no power over it ſelf, the agent is no more free than a ſtaff in a mans hand. Secondly, he makes but an empty ſhew of a power in the will, either to write or not to write. If it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely and inevitably determined in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences whatſoever, what a man ſhall will, and what he ſhall not will, what he ſhall write, and what he ſhall not write, to what purpoſe is this power? God and Nature never made any thing in vain, but vain and fruſtraneous is that power which never was and never ſhall be deduced into Act. Either the agent is determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he acteth, what he ſhall will, and what he ſhall not will, what he ſhall act, and what he ſhall not act, and then he is no more free to act than he is to will. Or els he is not determined, and then there is no neceſſity. No effect can exceed the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its cauſe; if the action be free to write or to forbear, the power or faculty to will, or nill, muſt of neceſſity be more free. <hi>Quod efficit tale illud magis eſt tale.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:169972:12"/> If the will be determined, the writing or not writing is likewiſe determined, and then he ſhould not ſay, <hi>he may write or he may forbear,</hi> but he muſt write, or he muſt forbear. Thirdly, this anſwer contradicts the ſenſe of all the world, that the will of man is determined <hi>without his will, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing in his power;</hi> Why do we ask men whether they will do ſuch a thing or not? Why do we repreſent reaſons to them? Why do we pray them? Why do we intreat them? Why do we blame them if their will come not upon them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their will. <hi>Wilt thou be made clean?</hi> ſaid our Saviour to the <hi>Paralitike</hi> perſon, <hi>John</hi> 5.6. to what purpoſe if his will was extrinſecally determined? Chriſt complains, <hi>We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced,</hi> Matth. 11.17. How could they help it, if their wills were determined without their wills to forbear? And Matth. 23.37. <hi>I would have gathered your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together as the Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, but ye would not.</hi> How eaſily might they anſwer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>T. H.</hi> his doctrine, Alas blame not us, Our wills are not in our own power or diſpoſition, if they were, we would thankfully embrace ſo great a favour. Moſt truly ſaid St. Auſtin, <note place="margin">De lib. Au. l. 3. c. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Our will ſhould not be a will at all, if it were not in our power.</hi> This is the belief of all mankind, which we have not learned from our Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169972:12"/> but is imprinted in our hearts by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; We need not turn over any obſcure books to find out this truth. The Poets chant it in the Theaters, the Shepheards in the mountains, The Paſtors teach it in their Churches, the Doctors in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities. The common people in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketts, and all mankind in the whole world do aſſent unto it, except an handfull of men, who have poiſoned their intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls with paradoxicall principles. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this neceſſity which <hi>T. H.</hi> hath devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which is grounded upon the neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mans will without his will, is the worſt of all others, and is ſo far from leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe difficulties and abſurdities which flow from the fatall deſtiny of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> that it increaſeth them, and rendreth them unanſwerable. No man blameth fire for burning whole Cities, No man taxeth poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for deſtroying men, but thoſe perſons who apply them to ſuch wicked ends. If the will of man be not in his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he is no more a free agent than the fire or the poiſon. Three things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make an act or omiſſion cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; Firſt, that it be in our power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, or forbear it, Secondly, that we be obliged to perform it, or forbear it reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively. Thirdly, that we omit that which we ought to have done, or do that which we ought to have omitted. No man ſins in doing thoſe things
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169972:13"/> which he could not ſhun, or forbearing thoſe things which never were in his power. <hi>T. H.</hi> may ſay, that beſides the power, men have alſo an appetite to evill objects, which renders them culpable. It is true, but if this appetite be determined by anothers, not by themſelves, Or if they have not the uſe of reaſon to curb or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their appetites, they ſin no more than a ſtone deſcending downeward, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its naturall appetite, or the brute beaſts who commit voluntary er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in following their ſenſitive appetites, yet ſin not.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then is not whether a man be neceſſitated to will or nill, yet free to act or forebear. But having the ambiguous acceptions of the word, free, the queſtion is plainly this, whether all agents, and all events natural, civill, moral (for we ſpeak not now of the converſion of a ſinner, that concerns not this queſtion,) be predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined extrinſecally and inevitably without their own concurrence in the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo as all actions and events which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are or ſhall be, cannot but be, nor can be otherwiſe, after any other manner, or in any other place, time, number, meaſure, order, nor to any other end, than they are. And all this in reſpect of the ſupreme cauſe, or a concourſe of extrinſecall cauſes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them to one.</p>
               <p>So my preface remaines yet unanſwered.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169972:13"/> Either I was extrinſecally and inevitably prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to write this diſcourſe, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of mine in the determination, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any power in me to change or oppoſe it, or I was not ſo predetermined; If I was, then I ought not to be blamed, for no man is juſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for doing that which never was in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to ſhun. If I was not ſo predetermined, then mine actions and my will to act, are neither compelled nor neceſſitated by any extrinſecall cauſes, but I elect and chooſe, either to write or to forbear, according to mine own will, and by mine own power. And when I have reſolved, and elected, it is but a neceſſity of ſuppoſition, which may and doth conſiſt with true liberty, not a real anteeedent neceſſity. The two hornes of this Dilemma are ſo ſtrait, that no mean can be given, nor room to paſs between them. And the two conſequences are ſo evident, that in ſtead of anſwering, he is forced to decline them.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169972:14"/> to do both good and evill, but a liberty to do or not to do this or that good, this or that evill reſpectively; or whether it be a liberty of <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification and exerciſe</hi> alſo, which the Schooles call liberty of <hi>contrariety,</hi> and is found in men indowed with reaſon and underſtanding, that is a liberty to do and not to do, good and evill, this or that.

                  <hi>IN the next place he maketh certain diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of liberty, and ſayes, he meanes not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from ſin, nor from ſervitude, nor from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but from neceſſity, neceſſitation, inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and determination to one; It had been better to define liberty than thus to diſtinguiſh, for I underſtand never the more what he meanes by liberty. And though he ſayes, he meanes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from neceſſitation, yet I underſtand not how ſuch a liberty can be, and it is a taking of the queſtion without proof, for what els is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between us but whether ſuch a liberty be poſſible or not. There are in the ſame place other diſtinctions, as a liberty of exerciſe only, which he calls a liberty of contradiction, (namely, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not good or evill ſimply, but of doing this or that good, or this or that evill reſpectively.) And a liberty of ſpecification and exerciſe alſo, which he calls a liberty of contrariety, namely, a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not only to do or not do, good or evill, but alſo to do or not do, this or that good or evill. And with theſe diſtinctions he ſayes, he cleares the coaſt, whereas in truth he darkeneth his medning,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169972:14"/> not onely with the Jargon of exerciſe onely, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification alſo, contradiction, contrariety, but alſo with pretending diſtinction where none is, for how is it poſſible for the liberty of doing or not doing this or that good or evill, to conſiſt (as he ſayes it doth in God and Angells) without a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of doing or not doing good or evill.</hi>

No men delight in confuſed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, but either Sophiſters or Bunglers. <hi>Vir do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſus verſatur in generalibus,</hi> deceitfull men do not love to deſcend to particulars; and when bad Archers ſhoot, the ſafeſt way is to run to the marke. Liberty is ſometimes oppoſed to the ſlavery of ſin and vitious habits, as Rom. 6.22. <hi>Now being made free from ſin.</hi> Sometimes to miſery and oppreſſion, Iſay 58.6. <hi>To let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free.</hi> Sometimes to ſervitude, as Levit. 25.10. <hi>In the year of Jubilee ye ſhall proclaim liberty throughout the land.</hi> Sometimes to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as Pſal. 105.20. <hi>The prince of his people let him go free.</hi> Yet none of all theſe are the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty now in queſtion, but a liberty from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that is a determination to one, or rather from neceſſitation that is a neceſſity impoſed by another, or an extrinſecall determination.

And though he ſay that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169972:15"/> 
                  <hi>he understands never the more what I mean by liberty,</hi> yet it is plain by his own ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, both that he doth underſtand it, and that this is the very queſtion where the water ſticks between us, whether there be ſuch a liberty free from all neceſſitation and extrinſecall determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to one. Which being but the ſtating of the queſtion, he calls it amiſs <hi>the taking of the queſtion.</hi> It were too much weakneſs to beg this queſtion, which is ſo copious and demonſtrable. It is ſtrange to ſee with what confidence now adayes particular men ſlight all the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Philoſophers, and Claſſick Authors of former ages, as if they were not worthy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe the ſhoe-ſtrings of ſome moderne Author, or did ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, untill ſome third <hi>Cato</hi> dropped down from heaven, to whom all men muſt repaire, as to the Altar of <hi>Promotheus,</hi> to light their torches. I did never wonder to heare a raw Divine out of the Pulpit declare againſt Schoole Divinity to his equally ignorant Auditors; It is but as the Fox in the Fable, who having loſt his own taile by a miſchance, would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded all his fellowes to cut off theirs, and throw them away as unprofitable burthens. But it troubles me to ſee a Scholar, one who hath been long admitted into the innermoſt cloſet of nature, and ſeene the hidden ſecrets of more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til learning, ſo far to forget himſelf, as to ſtile Schoole-learning no better than a plain <hi>Jargon,</hi> that is a ſenſeleſs gibriſh, or a fuſtian language, like the clattering noyſe of Sabots, ſuppoſe they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169972:15"/> did ſometimes too much cut truth into ſhreds, or delight in abſtruſe expreſſions, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this diſtinction of liberty, into liberty of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety</hi> and liberty of contradiction, or which is all one, of <hi>exerciſe onely,</hi> or <hi>exerciſe and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification jointly,</hi> which <hi>T. H.</hi> rejects with ſo much ſcorn, is ſo true, ſo neceſſary, ſo generally received, that there is ſcarce that writer of note, either Divine or Philoſopher, who did ever treat upon this ſubject, but he uſeth it.</p>
               <p>Good and evill are contraries, or oppoſite kinds of things, therefore to be able to chooſe both good and evill, is a liberty of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety or of ſpecification; To chooſe this, and not to chooſe this, are contradictory, or which is all one, an exerciſe or ſuſpenſion of power; Therefore to be able to do or forbear to do the ſame action, to chooſe or not chooſe the ſame object, without varying of the kind, is a liberty of contradiction, or of exerciſe onely. Now man is not onely able to do or forbear to do good onely, or evill onely, but he is able both to do and to forbear to do, both good and evill; ſo he hath not onely a liberty of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo a liberty of contrary objects; not onely a liberty of exerciſe, but alſo of ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not onely a liberty of contradiction, but alſo of contrariety. On the other ſide, God and the good Angels, can do or not do this or that good, but they cannot do and not do, both good and evill. So they have onely a liberty of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe or contradiction, but not a liberty of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification or contrariety. It appears then plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the liberty of man is more large in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169972:16"/> extenſion of the object, which is both good and evill, then the liberty of God and the good Angels, whoſe object is onely good. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the liberty of man comes ſhort in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the power. Man is not ſo free in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of good onely, as God, or the good Angels, becauſe (not to ſpeak of God whoſe liberty is quite of another nature) the underſtandings of the Angels are clearer, their power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over their actions is greater, they have no ſenſitive appetites to diſtract them, no Organs to be diſturbed; we ſee then this diſtinction is cleared from all darkneſs.</p>
               <p>And where <hi>T. H.</hi> demands how it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the liberty of doing, or not doing this or that good or evill, to conſiſt in God and Angels, without a liberty of doing or not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good or evill. The anſwer is obvious and eaſy, <hi>referendo ſingula ſingulis,</hi> rendering eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act to its right object reſpectively. God and good Angels have a power to do or not to do this or that good, bad Angels have a power to do or not to do this or that evill, ſo both joyntly conſidered, have power reſpectively to do good or evill. And yet according to the words of my diſcourſe, God, and good, and bad Angels being ſingly conſidered, have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do good or evill, that is, indifferently, as man hath.</p>

A Spontaneity may conſiſt with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to one, as we ſee in Children, Fools, mad Men, bruit Beaſts, whoſe fancies are determined to thoſe things which they act ſpontaneouſly, as the Bees makes Hony, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169972:17"/> Spiders Webs.

               <p>But men have liberty of election. This is plain <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.14. If a Wife make a vow its left to her Husbands choice, either to eſtabliſh it or to make it void.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument </seg>1</label> MY firſt Argument from Scripture is thus formed, Whoſoever have a liberty or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of election, are not determined to one by praecedent neceſſary cauſes.</p>
               <p>But Men have liberty of election.</p>
               <p>The aſſumtion or <hi>minor</hi> propoſition is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by three places of Scripture, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.14. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24, 12. I need not inſiſt upon theſe, becauſe <hi>T. H.</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>that it is clearly prooved that there is election in Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he denieth the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaith he) man <hi>is neceſſitated or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to what he ſhall chooſe</hi> by praecedent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes; I take away this anſwer three wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by reaſon; election is evermore either of things poſſible, or at leaſt of things concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be poſſible, That is efficacious election, when a man hopeth or thinketh of obteining the object. Whatſoever the will chooſeth, it chooſeth under the notion of good, either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt or delightfull or profitable, but there can be no reall goodneſs apprehended in that which is known to be impoſſible: It is true, there may be ſome wandring perdulous wiſhes of known impoſſibilities, as a man alſo hath committed an offence, may wiſh he had not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, But to chooſe effiaciouſly and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, is as impoſſible as an impoſſibility it ſelf. No man can think to obtein that which he knows impoſſible to be obteined, But he who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169972:18"/> knows that all things are antecedently determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by neceſſary cauſes, knows that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any thing to be otherwiſe then it is; Therefore to aſcribe unto him a power of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to chooſe this or that indifferently, is to make the ſame thing to be determined to one, and to be not determined to one, which are contradictories. Again, whoſoever hath an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective power or a liberty to chooſe, hath alſo a liberty or power to refuſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Before the Child ſhall know to refuſe the evill and chooſe the good.</hi> He who chooſeth this rather then that, refuſeth that rather then this. As <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> chooſing to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, did thereby refuſe the pleaſures of ſin. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. But no man hath any power to refuſe, that which is neceſſarily praedetermined to be, unleſs it be as the Fox refuſed the Grapes which were beyond his reach. When one thing of two or three is abſolutely determined, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are made thereby ſimply impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, I proove it by inſtances, and by that univerſal notion, which the world hath of election; what is the difference between an elective and hereditary Kingdom? but that in an elective Kingdom they have power or liberty to chooſe this or that Man indifferently, But in an haereditary Kingdom they have no ſuch power nor liberty. Where the Law makes a certain Heir, there is a neceſſitation to one; where the Law doth not name a certain Heir, there is no neceſſitation to one, and there they have power or liberty to chooſe. An haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169972:18"/> Prince may be as gratefull and acceptable to his ſubjects, and as willingly received by them (according to that liberty which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to compulſion or violence) as he who is choſen, yet he is not therefore an elective Prince. In <hi>Germany</hi> all the Nobility and Commons may aſſent to the choiſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, or be well pleaſed with it when it is concluded, yet none of them elect or chooſe the Emperour, but onely thoſe ſix Princes who have a conſultative, deliberative, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native power in his Election. And if their votes or ſuffrages be equally divided, three to three, then the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath the caſting voice. So likewiſe in Corporations or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, ſometimes the people, ſometimes the Common Councell, have power to name ſo many perſons for ſuch an office, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate, or Senate, or leſſer Councell reſpectively, to chooſe one of thoſe. And all this is done with that caution and ſecrecy, by billetts or other means, that no man knowes which way any man gave his vote, or with whom to be offended. If it were neceſſarily and inevitably predetermined, that this indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall perſon and no other ſhall and muſt be choſen, what needed all this circuit and caution, to do that which is not poſſible to be done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which one may do as well as a thouſand, and for doing of which no rationall man can be offended, if the Electors were neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to elect this man and no other. And though <hi>T. H.</hi> was pleaſed to paſſe by my Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169972:19"/> inſtance, yet I may not, untill I ſee what he is able to ſay unto it. The Junior of the Meſs in <hi>Cambridge</hi> divides the meat into foure parts, The Senior chooſeth firſt, then the ſecond and third in their order. The Junior is determined to one, and hath no choiſe left, unleſs it be to chooſe whether he will take that part which the reſt have refuſed, or none at all. It may be this part is more agreable to his mind than any of the others would have been, but for all that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to chooſe it, becauſe he is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this one. Even ſuch a liberty of election is that which is eſtabliſhed by <hi>T. H.</hi> Or rather much worſe in two reſpects. The Junior hath yet a liberty of contradiction left to chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will take that part or not take any part, but he who is preciſely predetermined to the choiſe of this object, hath no liberty to refuſe it. Secondly, the Junior by dividing carefully may preſerve to himſelf an equall ſhare, but he who is wholly determined by extrinſecall cauſes, is left altogether to the mercy and diſpoſition of another.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, I proove it by the texts alledged, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.13. If a wife make a vow, it is left to her husbands choiſe, either to eſtabliſh it or make it void. But if it be predetermined, that he ſhall eſtabliſh it, it is not in his power to make it void. If it be predetermined, that he ſhall make it void, it is not in his power to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it. And howſoever it be determined, yet being determined, it is not in his power indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, either to eſtabliſh it, or to make it void
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169972:19"/> at his pleaſure. So Joſhua 24.15. <hi>Chooſe you this day whom ye will ſerve: But I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> It is too late to chooſe that <hi>this day,</hi> which was determined otherwiſe yeſterday, <hi>whom ye will ſerve, whether the gods whom your fathers ſerved, or the gods of the Amorites.</hi> Where there is an election of this or that, theſe gods, or thoſe gods, there muſt needs be either an indifferency to both objects, or at leaſt a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of either. <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> If he were extrinſecally predetermined, he ſhould not ſay I will ſerve, but I muſt ſerve. And 2 Sam. 24.12. <hi>I offer thee three things, chooſe thee which of them I ſhall do.</hi> How doth God offer three things to <hi>Davids</hi> choiſe, if he had predetermined him to one of the three by a concourſe of neceſſary extrinſecall cauſes? If a ſoveraign Prince ſhould deſcend ſo far as to offer a delinquent his choice, whether he would be fined, or impriſoned, or baniſhed, and had under hand ſigned the ſentence of his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what were it els but plain drollery, or mockery? This is the argument which in <hi>T. H.</hi> his opinion looks another way. If it do, it is as the <hi>Parthians</hi> uſed to fight, flying. His reaſon followes next to be conſidered.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169972:20"/> of ones hopes and feares conſiſteth the nature of election. So that a man may both chooſe this, and cannot but chooſe this. And conſequently chooſing and neceſſity are joyned together.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THere is nothing ſaid with more ſhew of reaſon in this cauſe by the patrons of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and adverſaries of true liberty than this, That the will doth perpetually and infallibly follow the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, or the laſt judgment of right reaſon. And in this, and this onely, I confeſs <hi>T. H.</hi> hath good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds. Yet the common and approved opinion is contrary. And juſtly: For,</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, this very act of the underſtanding is an effect of the will, and a teſtimony of its power and liberty. It is the will, which affecting ſome particular good doth, ingage and command the underſtanding to conſult and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate what means are convenient for attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that end. And though the will it ſelf be blind, yet its object is good in generall, which is the end of all human actions. Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the will as to the Generall of an Army to moove the other powers of the ſoul to their acts, and among the reſt the underſtanding alſo, by applying it and reducing its power into act. So as whatſoever obligation the underſtanding doth put upon the will, is by the conſent of the will, and derived from the power of the will, which was not neceſſitated to moove the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to conſult. So the will is the Lady and Miſtris of human actions, the underſtanding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169972:20"/> is her truſty counſeller, which gives no adviſe, but when it is required by the will. And if the firſt conſultation or deliberation be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the will may moove a review, and require the underſtanding to inform it ſelf better, and take adviſe of others, from whence many times the judgment of the underſtanding doth receive alteration.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, for the manner how the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth determine the will, it is not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but morally. The will is mooved by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, not as by an efficient, having a cauſall influence into the effect, but only by propoſing and repreſenting the object. And therefore as it were ridiculous to ſay, that the object of the ſight is the cauſe of ſeeing, ſo it is to ſay, that the propoſing of the object by the underſtanding to the will, is the cauſe of willing; and therefore the underſtanding hath no place in that concourſe of cauſes which according to <hi>T. H.</hi> do neceſſitate the will.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, the judgment of the underſtanding is not alwayes <hi>practicè practicum,</hi> nor of ſuch a nature in it ſelf, as to oblige and determine the will to one. Sometimes the underſtanding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth two or three means equally available to the altering of one and the ſame end. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it dictateth, that this or that particular good is eligible or fit to be choſen, but not that it is neceſſarily eligible, or that it muſt be choſen. It may judge this or that to be a fit means, but not the onely meanes to atteine the deſired end. In theſe caſes no man can doubt, but that the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169972:21"/> will may chooſe, or not chooſe, this or that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently. Yea, though the underſtanding ſhall judge one of theſe means to be more expedient than another, yet for as much as in the leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient there is found the reaſon of good, the will in reſpect of that dominion which it hath over it ſelf, may accept that which the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding judgeth to be leſs expedient, and refuſe that which it judgeth to be more expedient.</p>
               <p n="4">Fourthly, ſometimes the will doth not will the end ſo efficaciouſly, but that it may be, and often is deterred from the proſecution of it by the difficulty of the means; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the judgment of the underſtanding, the will may ſtill ſuſpend its own act.</p>
               <p n="5">Fiftly, ſuppoſing but not granting, that the will did neceſſarily follow the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, yet this prooves no antecedent neceſſity, but coexiſtent with the act, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall neceſſity, the will and underſtanding being but two faculties of the ſame ſoul, no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, but meerly upon ſuppoſition. And therefore the ſame Authors who maintain that the judgment of the underſtanding doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily determine the will, do yet much more earneſtly oppugne <hi>T. H.</hi> his abſolute neceſſity of all occurrences. Suppoſe the will ſhall apply the underſtanding to deliberate and not require a review. Suppoſe the dictate of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhall be abſolute, not this or that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, nor this rather than that comparatively, but this poſitively, not this freely, but this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily. And ſuppoſe the will do well efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169972:21"/> and do not ſuſpend its own act. Then here is a neceſſity indeed, but neither abſolute, nor extrinſecall, nor antecedent, flowing from a concourſe of cauſes without our ſelves, but a neceſſity upon ſuppoſition, which we do readily grant. So far <hi>T. H.</hi> is wide from the truth, whileſt he mainteines, either that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a greater good doth neceſſitate the will, or that this is an abſolute neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas he ſaith, that <hi>the nature of election doth conſiſt in following our hopes and feares,</hi> I cannot but obſerve that there is not one word of Art in this whole Treatiſe, which he uſeth in the right ſenſe; I hope it doth not proceed out of an affectation of ſingularity, nor out of a contempt of former Writers, nor out of a deſire to take in ſunder the whole frame of Learning, and new mould it after his own mind. It were to be wiſhed that at leaſt he would give us a new Dictionary, that we might underſtand his ſenſe. But becauſe this is but touched here ſparingly and upon the by, I will forbear it, untill I meet with it again in its proper place. And for the preſent it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that hopes and feares are common to brute beaſts, but election is a rationall act, and is proper only to man, who is <hi>Sanctius his animal mentiſ<expan>

                  <hi>SUppoſing, it ſeemes, I might anſwer as I have done, that neceſſity and election might ſtand together, and inſtance in the actions of Children, fools, and brute beaſts, whoſe fancies I might ſay, are neceſſitated and determined to one: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe his proofs out of Scripture he deſires to prevent that inſtance, and therefore ſayes, that the actions of children, fools, mad-men and beaſts are indeed determined, but that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from election, nor from free, but from ſpontaneous Agents. As for example, that the Bee when it maketh honey does it ſpontaneouſly; And when the Spider makes his webb, he does it ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, and not by election. Though I never meant to ground any anſwer upon the experience of what Children, foools, mad-men and beaſts do, yet that your Lordſhip may underſtand what can be meant by ſpontaneous, and how it differs from voluntary, I will anſwer that diſtinction and ſhew, that it fighteth againſt its fellow Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Your Lordſhip is therefore to conſider, that all voluntary actions, where the thing that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169972:22"/> induceth the will is not fear, are called alſo ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous, and ſaid to be done by a mans own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. As when a man giveth money volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to another for merchandiſe, or out of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he is ſaid to do it of his own accord, which in Latin is <hi>Sponte,</hi> and therefore the action is ſpontaneous. Though to give ones money willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a thief to avoid killing, or throw it into the Sea to avoid drowning, where the motive is fear, be not called ſpontaneous. But every ſpontaneous action is not therfore voluntary, for voluntary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes ſome precedent deliberation, that is to ſay, ſome conſideration and meditation of what is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow, both upon the doing and abſtaining from the action deliberated of, whereas many actions are done of our own accord, and be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpontaneous; of which nevertheleſs as he thinks we never conſulted, nor deliberated of in our ſelves, as when making no queſtion, nor any the least doubt in the world, but that the thing we are about is good, we eat, or walk, or in anger ſtrike or revile, which he thinks ſpontaneous, but not voluntary nor elective actions. And with ſuch kind of actions he ſayes neceſſitation may ſtand, but not from ſuch as are voluntary, and proceed upon election and deliberation. Now if I make it appear to you, that even theſe actions which he ſayes proceed from ſpontaneity, and which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes only to fools, Children, mad-men, and beaſts, proceed from deliberation and election, and that actions inconſiderate, raſh and ſpontaneous are ordinarily found in thoſe that are by themſelves, and many more thought as wiſe or wiſer than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169972:23"/> men are. Then his Argument concludeth, that neceſſity and election may ſtand together, which is contrary to that which he intendeth by all the reſt of his Arguments to proove. And firſt your Lordſhips own experience furniſhes you with proof enough, that horſes, doggs, and other brute beaſts do demurre oftentimes upon the way they are to take. The horſe retiring from ſome ſtrange figure he ſees, and comming on again to avoid the ſpur. And what els does man that deliberateth, but one while proceed toward action, another while retire from it, as the hope of greater good drawes him, or the fear of greater evill drives him? A Child may be ſo young as to do all which it does without all deliberation, but that is but till it chance to be hurt by doing ſomewhat, or till it be of age to underſtand the rod; for the actions wherein he hath once a check, ſhall be delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the ſecond time. Fools and madmen mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly deliberate no leſs then the wiſeſt men, though they make not ſo good a choiſe, the images of things, being by diſeaſes altered. For Bees and Spiders, if be had ſo little to do as to be a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of their actions, he would have confeſſed not onely Election, but alſo Art, Prudence, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in them, very neer equall to that of mankind. Of Bees, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayes, their life is civill. He is deceived, if he think any ſpontaneous action af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once being checked in it, differs from an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on voluntary and elective, for even the ſetting of a mans foot in the poſture of walking, and the action of ordinary eating, was once deliberated, how and when it ſhould be done; And though it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169972:23"/> afterward become eaſy and habitual, ſo as to be done without fore-thought, yet that does not hinder, but that the act is voluntary, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from election. So alſo are the raſheſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of cholerick perſons voluntary and upon deliberation; for who is there but very young Children, that has not conſidered, when and how far he ought or ſafely may, ſtrike or revile, ſeeing then he agrees with me that ſuch actions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, and the fancy of thoſe that do them is determined to the actions they do, it follows out of his own doctrin, that the liberty of election does not take away the neceſſity of electing, this or that individuall thing. And thus one of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments fights againſt another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> WE have partly ſeen before how <hi>T. H.</hi> hath coined a new kind of liberty, a new kind of neceſſity, a new kind of election, and now in this ſection a new kind of ſpontaneity, and a new kind of voluntary actions. Although he ſay, that here is nothing new to him, yet I begin to ſuſpect, that either here are many things new to him, or otherwiſe his election is not the reſult of a ſerious mature deliberation. The firſt thing that I offer, is, how often he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes my meaning in this one ſection; firſt, I make voluntary and ſpontaneous actions to be one and the ſame, he ſaith I diſtinguiſh them, ſo as ſpontaneous actions may be neceſſary, but voluntary actions cannot. Secondly, I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between free acts and voluntary acts. The former are alwaies deliberate, the latter may be indeliberate; all free acts are voluntary, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169972:24"/> all voluntary acts are not free, but he ſaith I confound them and make them the ſame. Thirdly, he ſaith I aſcribe ſpontaneity onely to Fools, Children, Mad-Men and Beaſts, But I acknowledge ſpontaneity hath place in ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, both as it is comprehended in liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as it is diſtinguiſhed from liberty.</p>
               <p>Yet I have no reaſon to be offended at it; for he deals no otherwiſe with me then he doth with himſelf. Here he tells us, that <hi>voluntary, praeſuppoſeth deliberation.</hi> But <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. he tells us contrary, <hi>that whatſoever followeth the last appetite is voluntary, and where there is but one appetite, that is the laſt.</hi> And that <hi>no action of a man can be ſaid to be without deliberation, though never ſo ſuddain.</hi> So <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. he tells us, that <hi>by ſpontaneity is meant, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate proceeding, or elſe nothing is meant by it,</hi> yet here he tells us, that <hi>all voluntary actions which proceed not from fear, are ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,</hi> whereof many are deliberate, as that wherein he inſtanceth himſelf, <hi>to give mony for merchandiſe.</hi> Thirdly, when I ſaid that Children before they have the uſe of reaſon, act ſpontaneouſly, as when they ſuck the Breaſt, but do not act freely becauſe they have not judgement to deliberate or elect, Here <hi>T. H.</hi> undertakes to proove, that they do deliberate and elect. And yet preſently after confeſſeth again, that <hi>a Child may be ſo young, as to do what it doth without all deliberation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">Beſides theſe miſtakes and contradictions he hath other errours alſo in this ſection. As this,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169972:24"/> that no actions proceeding from fear are ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous. He who throws his goods into the Sea, to avoid drowning doth it not onely <hi>ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly</hi> but even <hi>freely,</hi> He that wills the end, wills the means conducing to that end. It is true that if the action be conſidered nakedly without all circumſtances, no man willingly or ſpontaneouſly caſts his goods into the Sea. But if we take the action as in this particular caſe inveſted with all the circumſtances, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the end, that is, the ſaving of his own life, it is not onely voluntary and ſpontaneous, but elective and choſen by him, as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means for his own preſervation. As there is an Antecedent and a ſubſequent will, ſo there is an Antecedent and a ſubſequent ſpontaneity: His Grammaticall argument, grounded upon the derivation of ſpontaneous from <hi>ſponte,</hi> weighs nothing; we have learned in the rudiments of Logick that conjugates are ſometimes in name onely, and not indeed. He who caſts his goods in the Sea, may do it of his own accord in order to the end. Secondly, he erres in this alſo, that nothing is oppoſed to ſpontaneity but onely fear. Invincible and Antecedent ignorance doth deſtroy the nature of ſpontaneity or volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, by removing that knowledge which ſhould and would have prohibited the action. As a man thinking to ſhoot a wild Beaſt in a Buſh, ſhoots his friend, which if he had known, he would not have ſhot. This man did not kill his friend of his own accord.</p>
               <p n="4">For the clearer underſtanding of theſe things,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169972:25"/> and to know what ſpontaneity is, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult a while with the Schools about the diſtinct order of voluntary or involuntary actions. Some acts proceed wholy from an extrinſecall cauſe; as the throwing of a ſtone upwards, a rape, or the drawing of a Chriſtian by plain force to the Idols Temple, theſe are called vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent acts. Secondly, ſome proceed from an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall cauſe, but without any manner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the end, as the falling of a ſtone down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, theſe are called naturall acts. Thirdly, ſome proceed from an internall principle, with an imperfect knowledge of the end, where there is an appetite to the object, but no delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor election, as the acts of Fools, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Beaſts, and the inconſiderate acts of men of judgement. Theſe are called voluntary or ſpontaneous acts. Fourthly, ſome proceed from an intrinſecal cauſe, with a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the end, which are elected upon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration. Theſe are called free acts. So then the formall reaſon of liberty is election. The neceſſary requiſite to election is deliberation. Deliberation implieth the actuall uſe of reaſon. But deliberation and election cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt, with an extrinſecall praedetermination to one. How ſhould a man deliberate or chooſe which way to go, who knows that all wayes are ſhut againſt him, and made impoſſible to him, but onely one? This is the genuine ſenſe of theſe words <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>ſpontaneous</hi> in this queſtion. Though they were taken twenty other wayes vulgarly or metaphorically, as we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169972:25"/> ſay <hi>ſpontaneous ulcers,</hi> where there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite at all, yet it were nothing to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, which is not about Words, but about Things; not what the words Voluntary or Free do or may ſignifie, but whether all things be extrinſecally praedetermined to one.</p>
               <p>Theſe grounds being laid for clearing the true ſenſe of the words, the next thing to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined is, that contradiction which he hath eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in my diſcourſe, or how this Argument fights againſt its fellows. If I (ſaith <hi>T. H.</hi>) make it appear, that the ſpontaneous actions of Fools, Children, Mad-Men and Beaſts, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from election and deliberation, and that inconſiderate and indeliberate actions are found in the wiſeſt men, then his argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that neceſſity and election may ſtand together, which is contrary to his aſſertion. If this could be made appear as eaſily as it is ſpoken, it would concern himſelf much, who when he ſhould proove, that rationall men are not free from neceſſity, goes about to proove that brute Beaſts do deliberate and elect, that is as much as to ſay, are free from neceſſity. But it concerns not me at all, It is neither my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor my opinion, that neceſſity and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may not meet together in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, violent, naturall, ſpontaneous, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate or elective acts may all meet together in the ſame ſubject. But this I ſay, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and election cannot conſiſt together in the ſame act. He who is determined to one, is not free to chooſe out of more then one. To
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169972:26"/> begin with his latter ſuppoſition, <hi>that wiſe men may do inconſiderate and indeliberate actions,</hi> I do readily admit it. But where did he learn to infer a generall concluſion from particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes? as thus, becauſe wiſe men do ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberate acts, therefore no act they do is free or elective. Secondly, for his former ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That fools, children, mad-men, and beaſts do deliberate and elect,</hi> if he could make it good, it is not I who contradict my ſelf, nor fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mine own aſſertion, but it is he who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours to proove that which I altogether deny. He may well find a contradiction between him and me, otherwiſe to what end is this diſpute? But he ſhall not be able to find a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my ſelf: But the truth is, he is not able to proove any ſuch thing; and that brings me to my ſixth Conſideration.</p>
               <p n="6">That neither Horſes, nor Bees, nor Spiders, nor Children, nor Fools, nor Mad-men do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate or elect. His firſt inſtance is in the Horſe or Dog, but more eſpecially the Horſe. He told me, that I divided my argument into ſquadrons, to apply my ſelf to your Lordſhip, being a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary man; And I apprehend, that for the ſame reaſon he gives his firſt inſtance of the Horſe, with a ſubmiſſion to your own experience. So far well, but otherwiſe very diſadvantagiouſly to his cauſe. Men uſe to ſay of a dull fellow, that he hath no more braines than an horſe. And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be not like the Horſe and Mule which have no underſtanding.</hi> Pſal. 32.9. How do they deliberate without underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169972:26"/> And Pſal. 49.20. he ſaith the ſame of all brute beaſts. <hi>Man being in honour had no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but became like unto the beaſts that periſh.</hi> The horſe <hi>demurres upon his way,</hi> Why not? Outward objects, or inward fancies may produce a ſtay in his courſe, though he have no judgment, either to deliberate or elect. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires from ſome ſtrange figure which he ſees, and comes on again to avoid the ſpur.</hi> So he may, and yet be far enough from deliberation. All this proceeds from the ſenſitive paſſion of fear, which is a perturbation ariſing from the expectation of ſome imminent evill. But he urgeth, what els doth man that deliberateth? Yes very much. The horſe feareth ſome outward object, but delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a comparing of ſeverall means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the ſame end. Fear is commonly of one, deliberation of more than one; fear is of thoſe things which are not in our power, deliberation of thoſe things which are in our power; fear ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth many times out of naturall antipathies, but in theſe diſconveniences of nature, deliberation hath no place at all. In a word, fear is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to deliberation, and betrayeth the ſuccours of the Soul. If the horſe did deliberate, he ſhould conſult with reaſon, whether it were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him to go that way or not; He ſhould repreſent to himſelf, all the dangers both of going, and ſtaying, and compare the one with the other, and elect that which is leſs evill; He ſhould conſider whether it were not better to endure a little hazard, than ungratefully and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtly to fail in his duty to his maſter, who did
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169972:27"/> breed him, and doth feed him. This the horſe doth not; Neither is it poſſible for him to do it. Secondly, for Children, <hi>T. H.</hi> confeſſeth that they may be ſo young, that they do not delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at all; Afterwards, as they attein to the uſe of reaſon by degrees, ſo by degrees they become free agents. Then they do deliberate, before they do not deliberate. The rod may be a means to make them uſe their reaſon, when they have power to exerciſe it, but the rod cannot produce the power before they have it. Thirdly, for fools and mad-men. It is not to be underſtood of ſuch mad-men as have their <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> who are mad and diſcreet by fitts; when they have the uſe of reaſon, they are no mad-men, but may deliberate as well as others. Nor yet of ſuch fools as are only comparative fools, that is, leſs wiſe than others. Such may deliberate, though not ſo clearly, nor ſo judiciouſly as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but of meer mad-men, and meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fools, to ſay that they, who have not the uſe of reaſon, do deliberate or uſe reaſon, implies a contradiction. But his chiefeſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in his Bees and Spiders, <hi>of whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>if I had been a ſpectator, I would have confeſſed, not only Election, but alſo Art, Prudence, Policy, very neer equall to that of mankind, whoſe life, as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>ſaith, is civill.</hi> Truly I have contemplated their actions many times, and have been much taken with their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works, yet my thoughts did not reflect ſo much upon them, as upon their maker, who is <hi>ſic magnus in magnis,</hi> that he is not, <hi>minor in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169972:27"/> parvis.</hi> So great in great things, that he is not leſs in ſmall things. Yes, I have ſeen thoſe ſillieſt of creatures, and ſeeing their rare works, I have ſeen enough to confute all the bold-faced A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts of this age, and their helliſh blaſphemies. I ſee them, but I praiſed the marveillous works of God, and admired that great and firſt intellect, who had both adapted their organs, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined their fancies to theſe particular works. I was not ſo ſimple to aſcribe thoſe Rarities to their own invention, which I knew to proceed from a meer inſtinct of Nature. In all other things they are the dulleſt of creatures. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts write of Bees, that their fancy is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not diſtinct from their common ſenſe, ſpread over their whole body, and only perceiving things preſent. When <hi>Ariſtotls</hi> calls them Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall or Sociable Creatures, he did not intend it really that they lived a civill life, but according to an Analogy, becauſe they do ſuch things by inſtinct, as truly Politicall Creatures do out of judgment. Nor when I read in Sr. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> of their <hi>Hexagonies</hi> or <hi>Sexangular</hi> celler, did I therefore conclude, that they were <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians.</hi> Nor when I read in <hi>Creſpet,</hi> that they invoke God to their aid, when they go out of their Hives, bending their thighs in forme of a croſs, and bowing themſelves; did I therefore think, that this was an act of religious piety, or that they were capable of <hi>Theologicall</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, whom I ſee in all other things in which their fancies are not determined, to be the ſillieſt of creatures, ſtrangers not only to right reaſon,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169972:28"/> but to all reſemblances of it.</p>
               <p n="7">Seventhly, concerning thoſe actions which are done upon precedent and paſſed delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; They are not only ſpontaneous, but free acts. Habits contracted by uſe and experience do help the will to act with more facility, and more determinately, as the hand of the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is helped by his tools. And precedent deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations, if they were ſad and ſerious, and prooved by experience to be profitable, do ſave the labour of ſubſequent conſultations, <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora,</hi> yet nevertheleſs the actions which are done by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of theſe formerly acquired habits are no leſs free, then if the deliberation were coexiſtent with this particular action. He that hath gained an habit and skill to play ſuch a leſſon, needs not a new deliberation how to play every time that he playes it over and over; yet I am far from giving credit to him in this, that walking or eating univerſally conſidered are free actions, or proceed from true liberty, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want a particular deliberation before every individuall act, as becauſe they are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall motions, and need no deliberation of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as we ſee in brute beaſts. And nevertheleſs the ſame actions, as they are conſidered indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, and inveſted with their due circumſtances, may be and often are free actions ſubverted to the liberty of the Agent.</p>
               <p n="8">Laſtly, whereas <hi>T. H.</hi> compareth the firſt motions or raſh attempts of cholerick perſons with ſuch acquired habits, it is a great miſtake,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169972:28"/> Thoſe raſh attempts are voluntary actions, and may be facilitated ſometimes by acquired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; But yet for as much as actions are often altered and varied by the circumſtances of Time, Place and Perſon, ſo as that act which at one time is morally good, at another time may be morally evill. And for as much as a generall precedent deliberation how to do this kind of action is not ſufficient to make this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action good or expedient, which being in it ſelf good, yet particular circumſtances may render inconvenient or unprofitable, to ſome perſons, at ſome times, in ſome places. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a precedent generall deliberation how to do any act, as for inſtance, how to write, is not ſufficient to make a particular act, as my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this individuall reply to be freely done, without a particular and ſubſequent delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A man learnes <hi>French</hi> adviſedly, that is a free act: The ſame man in his choler and paſſion reviles his friend in <hi>French,</hi> without any delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, This is a ſpontaneous act, but it is not a free act; If he had taken time to adviſe, he would not have reviled his friend. Yet as it is not free, ſo neither is it ſo neceſſary, as the Bees making hony, whoſe fancy is not only incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but determined by nature to that act. So every way he failes. And his concluſion, that the liberty of Election, doth not take away the neceſſity of electing this or that individuall thing, is no conſequent from my doctrine, but from his own. Neither do my arguments fight one againſt another, but his private opinions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169972:29"/> fight both againſt me and againſt an undoubted truth. A free agent endowed with liberty of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or with an elective power, may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs be neceſſitated in ſome individuall acts, but thoſe acts wherein he is neceſſitated, do not flow from his elective power, neither are thoſe acts which flow from his elective power neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated.</p>

                  <hi>THE ſecond argument from Scripture conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in Hiſtories of men, that did one thing, when if they would they might have done ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The places are two, one is in the <hi>1 Kings 3.11.</hi> Where the hiſtory ſayes, God was pleaſed that <hi>Salomon,</hi> who might, if he would, have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked riches or revenge, did nevertheleſs ask wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at Gods hands. The other is the words of <hi>St. Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Act. 5.4. After it was ſold, was it not in thine own power?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To which the anſwer is the ſame, with that I anſwered to the former places. That they proove there is election, but do not diſproove the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I maintain of what they ſo elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> WE have had the very ſame anſwer twice before. It ſeemeth that he is well pleaſed with it, or els he would not draw it in again ſo ſuddenly by head and ſhoulders, to no purpoſe, if he did not conceive it to be a Panchreſton, a ſalve for all ſores, or <hi>Dictamnum,</hi> ſoveraign Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, to make all his adverſaries weapons drop out of the wounds of his cauſe, onely by chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, without any application to the ſore. I will not waſt the time to ſhew any further, how the members of his diſtinction do croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one take away another. To make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry election to be of one thing impoſed by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and of another thing which is abſolutely impoſſible, is to make election to be no election at all. But I forbear to preſs that in preſent. If I may be bold to uſe his own phraſe; His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169972:30"/> looks quite another way from mine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. My ſecond reaſon was this, They who may do, and might have done many things which they leave undone, and who leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done many things which they might do, are not neceſſitated, nor preciſely, and antecently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do what they do.</p>
               <p>But we might do many things which we do not, and we do many things which we might leave undone, as appeares evidently by the texts alledged. Therefore we are not antecedently and preciſely determined, nor neceſſitated to do all things which he do. What is here of <hi>election</hi> in this Argument? To what propoſition, to what tearm doth <hi>T. H.</hi> apply his anſwer? He neither affirmes, nor denieth, nor diſtinguiſheth of any thing contained in my argument. Here I muſt be bold to call upon him for a more pertinent anſwer.</p>

But the plain truth is, that neither here, nor in his anſwer to the fift Argument, nor in this whole Treatiſe, is there one word of ſolution or ſatisfaction to this Argument, or to any part of it. All that looks like an anſwer is contained, Numb. 12. <hi>That which he does, is made juſt by his doing, Juſt I ſay, in him, not alwayes juſt in us by the example; for a man that ſhall command a thing openly, and plot ſecretly the hinderance of the ſame, if he puniſh him whom he commanded ſo, for not doing it, is unjuſt:</hi> I dare no inſiſt upon it, I hope his meaning is not ſo bad as the words intimate, and as I apprehend, That is to impute falſhood to him that is Truth it ſelf, and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie feining and diſſimulation in God, as he doth tyranny, by the infiniteneſs of his power, and the abſoluteneſs of his dominion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by his leave, I muſt once again tender him a new ſummons for a full and clear Anſwer to this Argument alſo. He tells us, that he was not ſurpriſed.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169972:32"/> production of that action hereafter, whereof if any one thing now were wanting, the effect could not be produced. This concourſe of cauſes, whereof every one is determined to be ſuch, as it is by a like concourſe of former cauſes, may well be called (in reſpect they were all ſet and ordered by the eternall cauſe of all things God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) the decree of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that the fore-knowledge of God, ſhould be a cauſe of any thing, cannot be truly ſaid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreknowledge is knowledge, and knowledge depends on the exiſtence of the things known, and not they on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The influence of the Stars is but a ſmall part of the whole cauſe, conſiſting of the concourſe of all Agents.</hi>

                  <hi>Nor doth the concourſe of all cauſes make one ſimple chain, or concatenation, but an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of chains joyned together, not in all parts, but in the firſt link, God Almighty; and conſequently the whole cauſe of an event, does not alwaies depend upon one ſingle chain, but on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naturall efficacy of objects does determine voluntary Agents, and neceſſitates the will, and conſequently the action; but for morall efficacy, I underſtand not what he means by it. The laſt dictate of the judgement concerning the good or bad that may follow on any action, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the whole cauſe, but the laſt part of it. And yet may be ſaid to produce the effect ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, in ſuch manner as the laſt feather may be ſaid to break an Horſes back, when there

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now for his Argument, That if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of all the cauſes neceſſitate the effect, that then it follows, <hi>Adam</hi> had no true liberty. I deny the conſequence, for I make not onely the effect, but alſo the election of that particular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to be neceſſary, in as much as the will it ſelf, and each propenſion of a man during his deliberation is as much neceſſitated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a ſufficient cauſe, as any thing elſe whatſoever. As for example, it is no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that fire ſhould burn, then that a man, or other creature, whoſe limbs be moved by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhould have election, that is, liberty to do what he has a fancy to, though it be not in his will or power to chooſe his fancy, or chooſe his election or will.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THis Argument was ſent forth onely as an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie to make a more full diſcovery, what were the true grounds of <hi>T. H.</hi> his ſuppoſed neceſſity; which errand being done, and the foundation whereupon he builds being found out, which is as I called it a concatenation of cauſes, and as he calles it a concourſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes; It would now be a ſuperfluous, and impertinent work in me to undertake the refutation of all thoſe other opinions, which he doth not undertake to defend. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169972:33"/> I ſhall wave them for the preſent, with theſe ſhort animadverſions.</p>
               <p>Concerning the eternall decree of God, he confounds the decree it ſelf with the execution of his decree. And concerning the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, he confounds that ſpeculative knowledge, which is called <hi>the knowledge of viſion,</hi> which doth not produce the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective objects, no more then the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive viſion doth produce the ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, with that other knowledge of God, which is called the <hi>knowledge of approbation,</hi> or <hi>a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall knowledge,</hi> that is, knowledge joyned with an act of the will, of which Divines do truly ſay, that it is the cauſe of things, as the knowledge of the Artiſt is the cauſe of his work. God made all things by his word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. that is, by his wiſdom. Concerning the influences of the Stars, I wiſh he had expreſſed himſelf more clearly; For as I do willingly grant, that thoſe Heavenly Bodies do act upon theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things, not onely by their motion and light, but alſo by an occult vertue, which we call influence, as we ſee by manifold experience in the Loadſtone, and Shell-fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So if he intend, that by theſe influences they do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally or phyſically determine the will, or have any direct dominion over humane Counſels, either in whole or in part, either more or leſs, he is in an errour. Concerning the concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cauſes, whereas he makes not one chain, but an innumerable number of chains, (I hope he ſpeaks hyperbolically, and doth not intend that they are actually infinite,) the difference
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169972:33"/> is not materiall whether one or many, ſo long as they are all joyned together, both in the firſt linck, and likewiſe in the effect. It ſerves to no end, but to ſhew what a ſhadow of liberty <hi>T. H.</hi> doth fancy, or rather what a dream of a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. As if one chain were not ſufficient to load poor man, but he muſt be clogged with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable chains. This is juſt ſuch another free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as the Turkiſh Galli-ſlaves do injoy. But I admire that <hi>T. H.</hi> who is ſo verſed in this queſtion, ſhould here confeſs, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not the difference between phyſicall, or naturall, and morall efficacy. And much more, that he ſhould affirm, that outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do determine voluntary agents by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall efficacy. No object, no ſecond agent, Angell or Devill, can determine the will of man naturally, but God alone, in reſpect of his ſupreme dominion over all things. Then the will is determined naturally, when God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, beſides his generall influence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all ſecond cauſes do depend, as well for their being as for their acting, doth moreover at ſometimes, when it pleaſeth him in caſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, concurre by a ſpeciall influence, and infuſe ſomething into the will, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an act, or an habit, whereby the will is moved, and excited, and applied to will or chooſe this or that. Then the will is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned morally, when ſome object is propoſed to it with perſwaſive reaſons and arguments to induce it to will. Where the determination is naturall, the liberty to ſuſpend its act is taken
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169972:34"/> away from the will, but not ſo where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination is morall. In the former caſe, the will is determined extrinſecally, in the latter caſe intrinſecally; The former produceth an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, the latter onely a neceſſity of ſuppoſition. If the will do not ſuſpend, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then the act is neceſſary; but becauſe the will may ſuſpend and not aſſent, therefore it is not abſolutely neceſſary. In the former caſe the will is moved neceſſarily and determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In the latter freely and indeterminately. The former excitation is immediate, the latter is <hi>mediate mediante intellectu,</hi> and requires the help of the underſtanding. In a word, ſo great a difference there is between naturall and morall efficacy, as there is between his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mine in this queſtion.</p>
               <p>There remains onely the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, which he maketh to be the laſt cauſe that concerneth to the determination of the will, and to the neceſſary production of the act, <hi>as the laſt feather may be ſaid to break an Horſes back, when there were ſo many laid on before, that there wanted but that to do it.</hi> I have ſhewed <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. that the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, is not alwaies abſolute in it ſelf, nor concluſive to the will, and when it is concluſive, yet it produceth no Antecedent nor Extrinſecall neceſſity; I ſhall onely adde one thing more in preſent, That by making the laſt judgement of right reaſon to be of no more weight then a ſingle feather, he wrongs the underſtanding as well as he doth the will, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169972:34"/> indeavours to deprive the will of its ſupreme power of application, and to deprive the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of its ſupreme power of judicature and definition. Neither corporeall agents and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor yet the ſenſitive appetite it ſelf, being an inferiour faculty, and affixed to the Organ of the Body, have any direct or immediate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or command over the rationall will. It is without the ſphear of their activity. All the acceſs which they have unto the will, is by the means of the underſtanding, ſometimes clear, and ſometimes diſturbed, and of reaſon either right or miſ-informed. Without the help of the underſtanding, all his ſecond cauſes were not able of themſelves to load the Horſes back with ſo much weight as the leaſt of all his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doth amount unto. But we ſhall meet with his Horſe load of feathers again <hi>Num.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus briefly touched, he proceeds to his anſwer. My argument was this, If any of theſe, or all of theſe cauſes formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, do take away true liberty, (that is, ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from neceſſity) then <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall had no true liberty.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall had true liberty.</p>
               <p>He miſ-recites the argument, and denies the conſequence, which is ſo clearly proved, that no man living can doubt of it. Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was ſubjected to all the ſame cauſes as well as we, the ſame decree, the ſame praeſcience, the ſame influences, the ſame concourſe of cauſes, the ſame efficacy of objects, the ſame dictates of reaſon. But it is onely a miſtake, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169972:35"/> plainly by his following diſcourſe, that he intended to deny, not the conſequence, but the Aſſumption; For he makes <hi>Adam</hi> to have had no liberty from neceſſity before his fall, yea he proceeds ſo far, as to affirm, that all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wills, his and ours, and each propenſion of our wills, even during our deliberation, are as much neceſſitated as any thing elſe whatſoever; that we have no more power to forbear thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which we do, then the fire hath power not to burn. Though I honour <hi>T. H.</hi> for his perſon, and for his learning, yet I muſt confeſs inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly, I hate this Doctrin from my heart. And I beleeve both I have reaſon ſo to do, and all others who ſhall ſeriouſly ponder the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid conſequences which flow from it. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes liberty, and diſhonours the nature of man. It makes the ſecond cauſes and outward objects to be the Rackets, and Men to be but the Tennis-Balls of deſtiny. It makes the firſt cauſe, that is, God Almighty, to be the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of all evill, and ſin into the world, as much as Man, yea more then Man, by as much as the motion of the Watch is more from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, who did make it and wind it up, then either from the ſpring, or the wheels, or the thred, if God by his ſpeciall influence into the ſecond cauſes, did neceſſitate them to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as they did. And if they being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, did neceſſitate <hi>Adam</hi> inevitably, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly, not by an accidentall, but by an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ſubordination of cauſes to whatſoever he did, Then one of theſe two abſurdities muſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169972:35"/> needs follow, either that <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſin, and that there is no ſuch thing as ſin in the world, becauſe it proceeds naturally, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and eſſentially from God. Or that God is more guilty of it, and more the cauſe of evill than man, becauſe man is extrinſecally, inevitably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but ſo is not God. And in cauſes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially ſubordinate, the cauſe of the cauſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the cauſe of the effect. What Tyrant did ever impoſe Lawes that were impoſſible for thoſe to keep upon whom they were impoſed, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for breaking thoſe Lawes which he himſelf had neceſſitated them to break, which it was no more in their power not to break, then it is in the power of the fire not to burn? Excuſe me if I hate this doctrine with a perfect hatred, which is ſo diſhonorable both to God and man, which makes men to blaſpheme of neceſſity, to ſteal of neceſſity, to be hanged of neceſſity, and to be damned of neceſſity. And therefore I muſt ſay and ſay again; <hi>Quicquid oſtendes mihi ſic incredulis odi.</hi> It were better to be an Atheiſt, to believe no God; or to be a Manichee, to believe two Gods, a God of good, and a God of evill; or with the Heathens, to believe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Gods, than thus to charge the true God to be the proper cauſe and the true Author of all the ſins and evills which are in the world.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To oppoſe hereunto, I muſt borrow an anſwer from <hi>St. Paul, Rom. 9. ver. 11.</hi> from the <hi>11.</hi> verſe of the Chapter to the <hi>18.</hi> is laid down the very ſame objection in theſe words. When they (meaning <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>) were yet unborn, and had done neither good nor evill, That the purpoſe of God according to election, not by works, but by him that calleth, might remain firm, it was ſaid to her (<hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Rebekah</hi>) that the elder ſhall ſerve the younger. And what then ſhall we ſay, is there iniustice with God? God forbid. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy. For the Scripture
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169972:36"/> ſaith to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> I have ſtirred thee up, that I I may ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name may be ſet forth in all the earth. Therefore whom God willeth, he hath mercy or, and whom he willeth he hardeneth. Thus you ſee the caſe put by <hi>St. Paul</hi> is the ſame with that of <hi>J. D.</hi> and the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in theſe words following, Thou wilt ask me then, why will God yet complain, for who hath reſiſted his will? To this therefore the Apoſtle anſwers, not by denying it was Gods will, or that the decree of God concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ſinned, or that <hi>Eſau</hi> was not neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to do what he did, but thus, Who art thou, O Man, that interrogateſt God? ſhall the work ſay to the workman, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay of the ſame ſtuff, to make one veſſell to honour, another to diſhonour? According therefore to this anſwer of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> I anſwer <hi>J .D</hi>'s objection, and ſay, The power of God alone, without other help, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Juſtification of any action he doth. That which men make among themſelves here by pacts and Covenants, and call by the name of Justice, and according whereunto men are counted and tearmed rightly juſt and unjuſt, is not that by which God Almighties actions are to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or called juſt, no more than his counſailes are to be meaſured by human wiſedom. That which he does is made juſt by his doing; Juſt I ſay in him, not always just in us by the Examples; for a man that ſhall command a thing openly, and plot ſecretly the hinderance of the ſame, if he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, he ſo commanded for not doing it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169972:37"/> So alſo his counſailes, they be therefore not in vain, becauſe they be his, whether we ſee the uſe of them or not. When God afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> he did object no ſin to him, but juſtified that afflicting him by telling him of his power. Haſt thou (ſayes God) an arm like mine? Where waſt thou when I layd the foundations of the earth? and the like. So our Saviour concerning the man that was born blind, ſaid, it was not for his ſin, nor his parents ſin, but that the power of God might be ſhewn in him. Beaſts are ſubject to death and torment, yet they cannot ſin. It was Gods will it ſhould be ſo. Power irreſiſtible juſtifieth all actions really and properly in whomſoever it be found. Leſs power does not. And becauſe ſuch power is in God only, he muſt needs be juſt in all his actions. And we, that not comprehending his Counſailes, call him to the Bar, commit injuſtice in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am not ignorant of the uſuall reply to this anſwer by diſtinguiſhing between will and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. As, that God Almighty does indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin ſometimes, And that he alſo foreknoweth that the ſin he permitteth ſhall be committed, but does not will it, nor neceſſitate it. I know alſo they diſtinguiſh the action from the ſin of the action, ſaying, God Almighty does indeed cauſe the action, whatſoever action it be, but not the ſinfulneſs or irregularity of it, that is, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance between the Action and the Law. Such diſtinctions as theſe dazell my underſtanding. I find no difference between the will to have a thing done, and the permiſſion to do it, when he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth it can hinder it, and knowes it will be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169972:37"/> done unleſs he hinder it. Nor find I any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between an action that is againſt the Law, and the ſin of that action. As for example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the killing of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and the ſin of <hi>David</hi> in killing <hi>Uriah.</hi> Nor when one is cauſe both of the action and of the Law, how another can be cauſe of the diſagreement between them, no more than how one man making a longer and ſhorter garment, another can make the inequallity that is between them. This I know, God cannot ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his doing a thing makes it juſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenly no ſin. And becauſe whatſoever can ſin, is ſubject to anothers Law, which God is not. And therefore tis blaſphemy to ſay, God can ſin. But to ſay, that God can ſo order the world as a ſin may be neceſſarily cauſed thereby in a man, I do not ſee how it is any diſhonour to him. Howſoever, if ſuch or other diſtinctions can make it clear that <hi>St. Paul</hi> did not think <hi>Eſaus</hi> or <hi>Pharaohs</hi> actions proceed from the will and purpoſe of God, or that proceeding from his will could not therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuſtice be blamed or puniſhed, I will as ſoon as I underſtand them turn unto <hi>J. D</hi>'s opinion. For I now hold nothing in all this queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, but what ſeemeth to me not obſcurely, but moſt expreſly ſaid in this place by <hi>Saint Paul.</hi> And thus much in anſwer to his places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:169972:38"/>

                  <label>J. D.</label> 
                  <hi>T. H.</hi> thinks to kill two birds with one ſtone, and ſatisfies two Arguments with one anſwer, whereas in truth he ſatisfieth neither. Firſt, for my third reaſon. Though all he ſay here, were as true as an Oracle. Though puniſhment were an act of dominion, not of Juſtice in God; yet this is no ſufficient cauſe why God ſhould deny his own Act, or why he ſhould chide or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate with men, why they did that which he himſelf did neceſſitate them to do, and whereof he was the actor more than they, they being but as the ſtone, but he the hand that threw it. Notwithſtanding any thing which is pleaded here, this Stoicall opinion doth ſtick hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and diſſimulation cloſe to God, who is the Truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And to my fift Argument, which he chargeth and relateth amiſs, as by comparing mine with his, may appear. His chiefeſt anſwer is to oppoſe a difficult place of <hi>St. Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.11. Hath he never heard, that to propoſe a doubt is not to anſwer an Argument, <hi>Nec bene reſpondet qui li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem lite reſolvit.</hi> But I will not pay him in his own coin. Wherefore to this place alledged by him, I anſwer, The caſe is not the ſame. The queſtion moved there, is, how God did keep his promiſe made to Abraham <hi>to be the God of him and of his ſeed,</hi> if the Jewes who were the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate progeny of <hi>Abraham</hi> were deſerted. To which the Apoſtle anſwers ver. 6. 7, 8. That that promiſe was not made to the carnall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, the Jewes, but to his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169972:38"/> Sons which were the Heirs of his Faith, that is to the beleeving Chriſtians; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he explicateth, firſt by the Allegory of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and after in the place cited of <hi>Eſau</hi> and of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Yet neither doth he ſpeak there ſo much of their perſons as of their poſterities. And though ſome words may be accommodated to Gods praedeſtination, which are there uttered, yet it is not the ſcope of that text, to treat of the reprobation of any man to hell-fire. All the poſterity of <hi>Eſau</hi> were not eternally reprobated, as holy <hi>Job</hi> and many others. But this queſtion which is now agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated between us, is quite of another nature, how a man can be a criminal who doth nothing but that which he is extrinſecally neceſſitated to do, or how God in Juſtice can puniſh a man with aeternall torments, for doing that, which it was never in his power to leave undone. That he who did impreſite the motion in the heart of man, ſhould puniſh man, who did onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the impreſſion from him. So his anſwer <hi>looks another way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe he grounds ſo much upon this text, that if it can be cleared he is ready to change his opinion, I will examin all thoſe paſſages which may ſeem to favour his cauſe. Firſt, theſe words ver. 11. <hi>being not yet borne, neither having done any good or evill,</hi> upon which the whole weight of his argument doth depend, have no reference at all to thoſe words ver. 13. Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated,</hi> for thoſe words were firſt uttered by the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169972:39"/> Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> many ages after <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were dead, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. and intended of the poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who were not redeemed from captivity, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were. But they are referred to thoſe other words, ver. 12. <hi>The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> which indeed were ſpoken before <hi>Jacob</hi> or <hi>Eſau</hi> were Born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.23. And though thoſe words of <hi>Malachy</hi> had been uſed of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> before they were Born, yet it had advantaged his cauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for hatred in that text doth not ſignify any reprobation to the flames of hell, much leſs the execution of that decree, or the actuall impoſition of puniſhment, nor any act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to love. God ſaw all that he made, and it was very good. Goodneſs it ſelf cannot hate that which is good. But hatred there ſignifies Comparative hatred, or a leſs degree of love, or at the moſt a negation of love. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.31. <hi>When the Lord ſaw that</hi> Leah <hi>was hated,</hi> we may not conclude thence that <hi>Jacob</hi> hated his Wife, The precedent verſe doth fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſenſe, ver. 30. Jacob <hi>loved</hi> Rachel <hi>more then</hi> Leah. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. No man can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will hate the one and love the other. So <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. If any Man hate not his Father and Mother, &amp;c. he cannot be my Diſciple. St. <hi>Mathew</hi> tells us the ſenſe of it <hi>Math.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe words ver. 15. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> do prove
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169972:39"/> no more but this, that the preferring of <hi>Jacob</hi> before <hi>Eſau,</hi> and of the Chriſtians before the Jews, was not a debt from God, either to the one or to the other, but a work of mercy. And what of this? All men confeſs that Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies do exceed mans deſerts, but Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do never exceed mans miſdeeds. As we ſee in the Parable of the Labourers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>Friend, I do thee no wrong, did not I agree with thee for a penny, Is it not lawfull for me to do with mine own as I will? Is thy eye evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am good?</hi> Acts of Mercy are free, but acts of Juſtice are due.</p>
               <p>That which follows ver. 17. comes ſomething nearer the cauſe, <hi>The Scripture ſaith unto</hi> Pharoah, <hi>for this ſame purpoſe I have raiſed thee up,</hi> (that is, I have made thee a King, or I have preſerved thee) <hi>that I might ſhew my power in thee.</hi> But this particle (that) doth not alwaies ſignifie the main end of an action, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times onely a conſequent of it. As <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.15. He departed into <hi>Egypt, that</hi> it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet, out of <hi>Egypt</hi> have I called my Son; without doubt <hi>Joſephs</hi> aim or end of his journey was not to fulfill prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but to ſave the life of the Child. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fulfilling of the prophecy was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of <hi>Joſephs</hi> journy, he ſaith, <hi>That it might be fulfilled.</hi> So here, <hi>I have raiſed thee up that I might ſhew my power.</hi> Again, though it ſhould be granted that this particle, <hi>that,</hi> did denote the intention of God to deſtroy <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Red Sea, yet it was not the Antecedent
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169972:40"/> intention of God, which evermore reſpects the good and benefit of the creature, but Gods conſequent intention upon the praeviſion of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> obſtinacy, that ſince he would not glorifie God in obeying his word, he ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God undergoing his judgements, Hitherto we find no aeternal puniſhments nor no tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment without juſt deſerts.</p>
               <p n="1">It follows ver. 18. <hi>whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:</hi> Indeed hardneſs of heart is the greateſt judgement that Gods lays upon a ſinner in this uſe, worſe then all the Plagues of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But how doth God harden the heart? not by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall influence of any evill act or habit into the will, nor by inducing the will with perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motives to obſtinacy and rebellion, <hi>for God tempteth no man, but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Jam. 1.13. Then God is ſaid to harden the heart three wayes, Firſt, negatively, and not poſitively, not by imparting wickedneſs, but by not imparting grace, as the Sun deſcending to the tropick of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> it is ſaid with us to be the cauſe of Winter, that is, not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting cold, but by not imparting heat. It is an act of mercy in God to give his grace free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to detein it is no act of injuſtice. So the Apoſtle oppoſeth hardning to ſhewing of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, To harden is as much as not to ſhew mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, God is ſaid to harden the heart occaſionally and not cauſally, by doing good, which incorrigible ſinners make an occaſion of growing worſe and worſe, and doing evill; as a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169972:40"/> Maſter by often correcting of an untoward Scholar, doth accidentally and occaſionally harden his heart, and render him more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, inſomuch as he growes even to deſpiſe the Rod. Or as an indulgent parent by his patience and gentleneſs doth incourage an obſtinate ſon to become more rebellious. So, whether we look upon Gods frequent judgments upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or Gods iterated favours in removing and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing thoſe judgments upon <hi>Pharaohs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, both of them in their ſeverall kinds, were occaſions of hardning <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, the one making him more preſumptuous, the other more deſperately rebellious. So that which was good, in it was Gods; that which was evill was <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs.</hi> God gave the occaſion, but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the true cauſe of his own obduration. This is cleerly confirmed Gen. 8.15. <hi>When</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaw that there was reſpite, he hardned his heart.</hi> And Gen. 9.34. <hi>When</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaw, that the Rain and the Hail, and the Thunders were cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he ſinned yet more, and hardned his heart, he and his ſervants.</hi> So Pſal. 105.25. <hi>He tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, ſo that they hated his people, and dealt ſubtilly with them:</hi> That is, God bleſſed the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did take occaſion to hate them, as is plain <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. ver. 7, 8, 9, 10. So God hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardened his own heart. God hardened it by not ſhewing mercy to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as he did to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who was as great a ſinner as he, or God hardned it occaſionally, but ſtill <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the true cauſe of his own
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169972:41"/> obduration, by determining his own will to evill, and confirming himſelf in his obſtinacy. So are all preſumptuous ſinners Pſal. 95.8. <hi>Harden not your hearts as in the provocation, as in the day of temptation in the wilderneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, God is ſaid to harden the heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively, but not operatively, nor effectively, as he who only lets looſe a Greyhound out of the ſlip, is ſaid to hound him at the Hare. Will you ſee plainly what St. <hi>Paul</hi> intends by hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? Read ver. 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath and to make his power known</hi> (that is, by a conſequent will, which in order of nature followes the proviſion of ſin,) <hi>indured with much long ſuffering the veſſells of wrath fitted to deſtruction. And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſells of mercy, &amp;c.</hi> There is much difference between <hi>induring</hi> and <hi>impelling,</hi> or inciting the veſſells of wrath. He ſaith of the veſſells of mercy, that <hi>God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them unto glory.</hi> But of the veſſells of wrath, he ſaith only, that they were <hi>fitted to deſtruction,</hi> that is, not by God, but by themſelves. <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, that God doth <hi>endure the veſſells of wrath with much long ſuffering,</hi> T. H. ſaith, that God wills and effects by the ſecond cauſes all their actions good and bad, that he neceſſitateth them, and determineth them irreſiſtibly to do thoſe acts which he condemneth as evill, and for which he puniſheth them. <hi>If doing willingly, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during, If much long ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> imply not a contrariety one to another, <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat mihi minam Diogenes,</hi> Let him that taught
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169972:41"/> me Logick, give me my money again.</p>
               <p>But <hi>T. H.</hi> ſaith, that this diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>operative</hi> and <hi>permiſſive</hi> Will of God; And that other between the action and the irregularity do dazell his underſtanding. Though he can find no difference between theſe two, yet others do, <hi>St. Paul</hi> himſelf did, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.18. <hi>About the time of</hi> 40. <hi>yeares ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered he their manners in the Wilderneſs.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Who intimes paſt ſuffered all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to walk in their own wayes.</hi> T. H. would make ſuffering to be inciting, their manners to be Gods manners, their wayes to be Gods wayes. And <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. <hi>The times of this ignorance God winked at.</hi> It was never heard that one was ſaid to wink or connive at that which was his own act. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able.</hi> To tempt is the Devills act, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called the <hi>Tempter,</hi> God tempts no man to ſin, but he ſuffers them to be tempted. And ſo ſuffers, that he could hinder Sathan, if he would. But by <hi>T. H.</hi> his doctrine, To tempt to ſin, and to ſuffer one to be tempted to ſin, when it is in his power to hinder it, is all one. And ſo he transforms God (I write it with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) into the Devill, and makes tempting to be Gods own work, and the Devill to be but his inſtrument. And in that noted place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance, but after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169972:42"/> wrath, and revealation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi> Here are as many convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this one text againſt the opinion of <hi>T. H.</hi> almoſt as there are words. Here we learn that God is <hi>rich in goodneſs,</hi> and will not puniſh his creatures for that which is his own act; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he <hi>ſuffers</hi> and <hi>forbeares ſinners long,</hi> and doth not ſnatch them away by ſudden death as they deſerve. Thirdly, that the reaſon of Gods forbearance is to <hi>bring men to repentance.</hi> Fourthly, that <hi>hardneſs of heart and impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is not caſually from God, but from our ſelves. Fiftly, that it is not the inſufficient propoſall of the means of their converſion on Gods part, which is the cauſe of mens perdition, but their own contempt and <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of theſe means. Sixtly, that puniſhment is not an act of abſolute dominion, but an act of <hi>righteous Judgment,</hi> whereby God renders to every man according to his own deeds, wrath to them and only to them who <hi>treaſure up wrath unto themſelves,</hi> and eternall life to thoſe <hi>who continue patiently in well-doing.</hi> If they deſerve ſuch puniſhment who onely neglect the goodneſs and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God, what do they who utterly deny it, and make Gods doing and his ſuffering to be all one? I do beſeech <hi>T. H.</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a degree of wilfulneſs it is, out of one obſcure text wholly miſunderſtood, to contradict the clear current of the whole Scripture. Of the ſame mind with St. <hi>Paul</hi> was St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.22. <hi>The long ſuffering of God waited once in the dayes of Noah.</hi> And 2 Pet. 3.15. <hi>Account that the long ſuffering of the Lord is ſalvation.</hi> This
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169972:42"/> is the name God gives himſelf. Exod. 34.6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gracious, long ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I do acknowledge that which <hi>T. H.</hi> ſaith to be commonly true, That he who doth permit any thing to be done, which it is in his power to hinder, knowing that if he do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, it will be done, doth in ſome ſort will it. I ſay in ſome ſort, that is, either by an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will, or by a conſequent will, either by an operative will, or by a permiſſive will, or he is willing to let it be done, but not willing to do it. Sometimes an antecedent engagement doth cauſe a man to ſuffer that to be done, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would not ſuffer. So <hi>Darius</hi> ſuffered <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> to be caſt into the Lions den, to make good his raſh decree; So <hi>Herod</hi> ſuffered <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to be beheaded, to make good his raſh oath; How much more may the immutable rule of juſtice in God, and his fidelity in keeping his word, draw from him the puniſhment of obſtinate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though antecedently he willeth their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? He loveth all his Creatures well, but his own Juſtice better. Again, ſometimes a man ſuffereth that to be done, which he doth not will directly in it ſelf, but indirectly for ſome other end, or for the producing of ſome great good; As a man willeth that a putrid member be cut off from his body, to ſave the life of the whole. Or as a Judge being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſave a malefactors life, and having po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to repreive him, doth yet condemn him for example ſake, that by the death of one, he may
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169972:43"/> ſave the lives of many. Marvell not then if God ſuffer ſome creatures to take ſuch courſes as tend to their own ruine, ſo long as their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings do make for the greater manifeſtation of his glory, and for the greater benefit of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants. This is a moſt certain truth, that God would not ſuffer evill to be in the world, unleſs he knew how to draw good out of evill. Yet this ought not to be ſo underſtood, as if we made any priority or poſteriority of time in the acts of God, but onely of nature. Nor do we make the antecedent and conſequent will to be contrary one to another, becauſe the one reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects man pure and uncorrupted, the other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects him as he is lapſed. The objects are the ſame, but conſidered after a diverſe manner. Nor yet do we make theſe wills to be diſtinct in God, for they are the ſame with the divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which is one. But the diſtinction is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the objects or things willed. Nor, laſtly, do we make this permiſſion to be a naked or a meer permiſſion, God cauſeth all good, permitteth all evill, diſpoſeth all things, both good and evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. H.</hi> demands how God ſhould be the cauſe of the action and yet not be the cauſe of the irregularity of the action. I anſwer, becauſe he concurres to the doing of evill by a generall, but not by a ſpeciall influence. As the Earth gives nouriſhment to all kinds of plants, as well to Hemlock as to Wheat, but the reaſon why the one yields food to our ſuſtenance, the other poiſon to our deſtruction, is not from the generall nouriſhment of the earth, but from the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169972:43"/> ſpeciall quality of the root. Even ſo the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power to act is from God, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> This is good. But the ſpecification, and determination, of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall power, to the doing of any evill, is from our ſelves, and proceeds from the free will of man; This is bad. And to ſpeak properly, the free will of man is not the efficient cauſe of ſin, as the root of the Hemlock is of poiſon, ſin ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no fruentity or being in it, as poiſon hath. But rather the deficient cauſe. Now no defect can flow from him who is the higheſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore <hi>T. H.</hi> is mightily miſtaken, to make the particular and determinate act of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Uriah</hi> to be from God. The generall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to act is from God, but the ſpecification of this generall and good power to murther, or to any particular evill, is not from God, but from the free will of man. So <hi>T. H.</hi> may ſee clearly if he will, how one may be the cauſe of the Law, and likewiſe of the action in ſome ſort, that is, by generall influence; and yet another cauſe concurring by ſpeciall influence and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this generall and good power may make it ſelf the true cauſe of the anomy or the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore he may keep his longer and ſhorter garments for ſome other occaſion. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they will not fit this ſubject, unleſs he could make generall and ſpeciall influence to be all one.</p>
               <p>But <hi>T. H.</hi> preſſeth yet further, that the caſe is the ſame, and the objection uſed by the Jews, ver. 19. <hi>Why doth he yet find fault? who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169972:44"/> his will?</hi> is the very ſame with my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And <hi>St. Pauls</hi> anſwer ver. 20. <hi>O man who art thou that replieſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over his clay, &amp;c?</hi> is the very ſame with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in this place, drawn from the irreſiſtible power, and abſolute dominion of God, which juſtifieth all his actions. And that the Apoſtle in his anſwer doth not deny, that it was Gods will, nor that Gods decree was before <hi>Eſaus</hi> ſin. To which I reply.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, that the caſe is not at all the ſame, but quite different, as may appear by theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; firſt, thoſe words, <hi>before they had done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evill,</hi> are not, cannot be referred to thoſe other words, <hi>Eſau have I hated;</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If they could, yet it is leſs than nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before <hi>Eſau</hi> had actually ſinned, his future ſins were known to God; Thirdly, by the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters clay, here is not to be underſtood the pure maſs, but the corrupted maſs of mankind. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the hating here mentioned is onely a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative hatred, that is, a leſs degree of love. Fiftly, the hardening which <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, is not a poſitive, but a negative obduration, or a not imparting of grace. Sixtly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of any poſitive reprobation to eternall puniſhment, much leſs doth he ſpeak of the actuall inflicting of puniſhment without ſin, which is the queſtion between us, and wherein <hi>T. H.</hi> differs from all that I remember to have read, who do all acknowledge that puniſhment
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169972:44"/> is never actually inflicted but for ſin. If the queſtion be put, why God doth good to one more than to another, or why God imparteth more grace to one than to another, as it is there, the anſwer is juſt and fit, becauſe it is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and it is ſawcineſs in a creature in this caſe to reply, <hi>May not God do what he will with his own, Matth.</hi> 20.15. No man doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but God imparteth grace beyond mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; But if the caſe be put, why God doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one more than another, or why he throws one into hell-fire, and not another, which is the preſent caſe agitated between us; To ſay with <hi>T. H.</hi> that it is becauſe God is Omnipotent, or becauſe his power is irreſiſtible, or meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his pleaſure, is not only not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but is plainly condemned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place. So many differences there are between thoſe two caſes. It is not therefore againſt God, that I reply, but againſt <hi>T. H.</hi> I do not call my Creator to the Bar, but my fellow creature; I ask no account of Gods counſails, but of mans preſumptions. It is the mode of theſe times to father their own fancies upon God, and when they cannot juſtifie them by reaſon, to plead his Omnipotence, or to cry. <hi>O altitudo,</hi> that the wayes of God are unſearchable. If they may juſtifie their drowſy dreams, becauſe Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer &amp; dominion is abſolute; much more may we reject ſuch phantaſticall deviſes which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the truth, and goodneſs &amp;, Juſtice of God, and make him to be a Tyrant, who is the Father of Mercies, and the God of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169972:45"/> The unſearchableneſs of Gods wayes ſhould be a bridle to reſtrain preſumption, and not a ſanctuary for ſpirits of error.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, this objection conteined ver. 19. to which the Apoſtle anſwers ver. 20. is not made in the perſon of <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as <hi>T. H.</hi> ſuppoſeth, but of the unbelieving Jews, who thought much at that grace and favour which God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vouchſafe unto the Gentiles, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them for his people, which honour they would have appropriated to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And the Apoſtles anſwer is not only drawn from the Soveraign Dominion of God, to impart his grace to whom he pleaſeth, as hath been ſhewed already, but alſo from the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and proper fault of the Jews, as appeareth ver. 22. <hi>What if God willing</hi> (that is, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will) <hi>to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering the veſſells of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi> They acted, God endured; They were tolerated by God, but fitted to deſtruction by themſelves, for their much wrong doing, here is Gods <hi>much long ſuffering;</hi> And more plainly ver. 31. <hi>Iſrael hath not atteined to the Law of righteouſneſs, wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</hi> This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſet down yet more emphatically in the next Chapter ver. 3. <hi>They</hi> (that is, <hi>the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites) being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs</hi> (that is, by faith in Chriſt,) <hi>and going about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own righteouſneſs,</hi> (that is, by the works of the Law) <hi>have not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169972:45"/> to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> And yet moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly Chap. 11. v. 20. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, but thou ſtandeſt by faith,</hi> Neither was there any precedent binding decree of God, to neceſſitate them to unbelief, and conſequently to puniſhment, It was in their own power by their concurrence with Gods grace to prevent theſe judgments, and to recover their former eſtate, ver. 23. <hi>If they</hi> (that is, the unbelieving Jews) <hi>abide not ſtill in unbelief, they ſhall be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in.</hi> The Crown and the Sword are immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, (to uſe St. <hi>Anſelmes</hi> compariſon) but it is we that move and change places. Sometimes the Jews were under the Crown, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles under the Sword, ſometimes the Jews under the Sword, and the Gentiles under the Crown.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though I confeſs, that human Pacts are not the meaſure of Gods Juſtice, but his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is his own immutable will, whereby he is ready to give every man that which is his own: as rewards to the good, puniſhments to the bad, ſo nevertheleſs God may oblige himſelf freely to his creature. He made the Covenant of works with mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth not man contrary to his own Covenant, but for the tranſgreſſion of his duty. And Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice is not meaſured by Omnipotence, or by irreſiſtible power, but by Gods will; God can do many things according to his abſolute power which he doth not; He could raiſe up children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of ſtones, but he never did ſo. It is a rule in Theology, that God cannot do any thing which argues any wickedneſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169972:46"/> as God cannot deny himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. He cannot lie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. Theſe and the like are fruits of impotence, not of power. So God cannot deſtroy the righteous with the wicked, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. He could not deſtroy <hi>Sodome</hi> whilſt <hi>Lot</hi> was in it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. not for want of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or power, but becauſe it was not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Juſtice, nor to that Law which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had conſtituted. The Apoſtle ſaith Heb. 6.10. <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your work.</hi> As it is a good conſequence to ſay, this is from God, therefore it is righteous, ſo is this alſo; This thing is unrighteous, therefore it cannot proceed from God. We ſee how all Creatures by inſtinct of nature do love their young, as the Hen her Chickens, how they will expoſe themſelves to death for them; And yet all theſe are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of that love which is in God towards his Creatures. How impious is it then to conceive, that God did creat ſo many millions of ſouls to be tormented eternally in hell, without any fault of theirs, except ſuch as he himſelf did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate them unto, meerly to ſhew his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and becauſe his power is irreſiſtible? The ſame privilege which <hi>T. H.</hi> appropriates here to power abſolutely irreſiſtible, a friend of his in his book <hi>de Cive cap.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 70. aſcribes to power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively irreſiſtible, or to Soveraign Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, whoſe power he makes to be as abſolute as a mans power is over himſelf, not to be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any thing, but only by their ſtrength. The greateſt propugners of Soveraign power think it enough for Princes to challenge an immunity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169972:46"/> from coercive power, but acknowledge, that the Law hath a directive power over them. But <hi>T. H.</hi> will have no limits but their ſtrength. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they do by power, they do juſtly.</p>
               <p>But, ſaith he, God objected no ſin to <hi>Job,</hi> but juſtified his afflicting him by his power. Firſt, this is an Argument from authority negatively, that is to ſay, worth nothing. Secondly, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of <hi>Job</hi> were no vindicatory puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to take vengeance of his ſins, (whereof we diſpute,) but probatory chaſtiſements to make triall of his graces. Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> was not ſo pure, but that God might juſtly have laid grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhments upon him, then thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he ſuffered. Witneſs his impatience, even to the curſing of the day of his nativity, <hi>Job</hi> 3.3. Indeed God ſaid to <hi>Job, where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?</hi> Job 38.4. that is, how canſt thou judge of the things that were done before thou waſt born? or comprehend the ſecret cauſes of my judgments? And Job 42.9. <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, why art thou impatient? doeſt thou think thy ſelf able to ſtrive with God? But that God ſhould puniſh <hi>Job</hi> without deſert, here is not a word.</p>
               <p>Concerning the blind man, mentioned <hi>John</hi> 9. his blindneſs was rather a bleſſing to him than a puniſhment, being the means to raiſe his Soul illuminated, and to bring him to ſee the face of God in Jeſus Chriſt. The ſight of the body is common to us with Ants and Flies, but the ſight of the ſoul with the bleſſed Angells. We
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169972:47"/> read of ſome, who have put out their bodily eyes becauſe they thought they were an impediment to the eye of the Soul. Again, neither he nor his parents were innocent, being conceived and born in ſin and iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. And in many things we offend all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. But our Saviours meaning is evident by the Diſciples queſtion, ver. 2. They had not ſo ſinned, that he ſhould be born blind. Or they were not more grievous ſinners than other men, to deſerve an exemplary judgment more than they; but this corporall blindneſs befell him principally by the extraordinary providence of God, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his own glory, in reſtoring him to his ſight. So his inſtance halts on both ſides; neither was this a puniſhment, nor the blind man free from ſin. His third inſtance of the death and torments of beaſts, is of no more weight then the two former. The death of brute beaſts is not a puniſhment of ſin, but a debt of nature. And though they be often ſlaughtered for the uſe of man, yet there is a vaſt difference between thoſe light and momentary pangs, and the unſufferable and endleſs pains of hell; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the meer depriving of a creature of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, and the ſubjecting of it to eternall death; I know the Philoſophicall ſpeculations of ſome who affirme, that entity is better than non-entity, that it is better to be miſerable, and ſuffer the torments of the damned, than to be annihilated, and ceaſe to be altogether. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which they ſpeak of, is a Metaphyſicall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity abſtracted from the matter, which is better
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169972:47"/> than non-entity, in reſpect of ſome goodneſs, not morall nor naturall, but tranſcendentall, which accompanies every being. But in the concrete it is far otherwiſe, where that of our Saviour often takes place, Matth. 26.24. <hi>Woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, It had been good for that man, that he had not been born.</hi> I add, that there is an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall Juſtice and Mercy due, even to the brute beaſts. <hi>Thou ſhalt not muſſle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corn.</hi> And, <hi>a juſt man is mercifull to his beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his greateſt errour is that which I touched before, to make Juſtice to be the proper reſult of Power. Power doth not meaſure and regulate Juſtice, but Juſtice meaſures &amp; regulates Power. The will of God, and the Eternall Law which is in God himſelf, is properly the rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Juſtice. As all goodneſs whether Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or Morall, is a participation of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all created Rectitude is but a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of divine rectitude, ſo all Lawes are but participations of the eternall Law, from whence they derive their power. The rule of Juſtice then is the ſame both in God and us, but it is in God, as in him that doth regulate and meaſure; in us, as in thoſe who are regulated and meaſured. As the will of God is immutable, alwayes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what is juſt and right and good; So his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice likewiſe is immutable. And that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall action which is juſtly puniſhed as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in us, cannot poſſibly proceed from the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall influence and determinative power of a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169972:48"/> juſt cauſe. See then how groſſely <hi>T. H.</hi> doth underſtand that old and true principle, that <hi>the Will of God is the rule of Juſtice,</hi> as if by willing things in themſelves unjuſt, he did render them juſt, by reaſon of his abſolute dominion and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible power. As fire doth aſſimilate other things to it ſelf, and convert them into the nature of fire. This were to make the eternall Law a <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule. Sin is defined to be <hi>that which is done, or ſaid, or thought contrary to the eternall Law.</hi> But by this doctrine nothing is done, nor ſaid, nor thought contrary to the will of God. St. <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſaid moſt truly, <hi>then the will of man is good and juſt and right, when he wills that which God would have him to will:</hi> but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine every man alwayes wills that which God would have him to will. If this be true, we need not pray, <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven, T. H.</hi> hath deviſed a new kind of heaven upon earth. The worſt is, it is an heaven without Juſtice. Juſtice is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetuall act of the will, to give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one his own; But to inflict puniſhment for thoſe things which the Judge himſelf did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and neceſſitate to be done, is not to give every one his own; right punitive Juſtice is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of equallity and proportion, between the demerit and the puniſhment; But ſuppoſing this opinion of abſolute and univerſall neceſſity, there is no demerit in the world, we uſe to ſay, that right ſprings from Law and fact, as in this Syllogiſm, Every thief ought to be puniſhed, there's the Law; But ſuch an one is a thief,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169972:48"/> there's the fact, therefore he ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, there's the right. But this opinion of <hi>T. H.</hi> grounds the right to be puniſhed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon Law, nor upon Fact, but upon the irreſiſtible power of God. Yea, it overturneth as much, as in it lies all Law; Firſt, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Law, which is the ordination of divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by which all Creatures are directed to that end which is convenient for them. That is, not to neceſſitate them to eternall flames. Then, the Law, participated, which is the ordination of right reaſon, inſtituted for the common good, to ſhew unto man, what he ought to do, and what he ought not to do. To what purpoſe is it to ſhew the right way to him who is drawn and haled a contrary way by Adamantine bonds of inevitable neceſſity?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, howſoever <hi>T. H.</hi> cries out, that God cannot ſin, yet in truth he makes him to be the principall and moſt proper cauſe of all ſin. For, he makes him to be the cauſe not onely of the Law, and of the action, but even of the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity it ſelf, and the difference between the action and the Law, wherein the very eſſence of ſin doth conſiſt. He makes God to determin <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> will, and neceſſitate him to kill <hi>Uriah.</hi> In cauſes phyſically, and eſſentially ſubordinate, the cauſe of the cauſe is evermore the cauſe of the effect. Theſe are thoſe deadly fruits which ſpring from the poiſonous root of the abſolute neceſſity of all things, which <hi>T. H.</hi> ſeeing, and that neither the ſins of <hi>Eſau,</hi> nor <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor any wicked perſon do proceed from the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169972:49"/> but from the permiſſive will of God; And that puniſhment is an act of juſtice, not of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion onely, I hope that according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he will change his opinion.</p>

                  <hi>OF the Arguments from reaſon, the firſt is, that which he ſaith, is drawn from <hi>Zenos</hi> beating of his man which is therefore called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum baculinum,</hi> that is to ſay, a wooden Argument. The ſtory is this, <hi>Zeno</hi> held that all actions were neceſſary, His man therefore being for ſome fault beaten, excuſed himſelf upon the neceſſity of it. To avoid this excuſe, his maſter pleaded likewiſe the neceſſity of beating him. So that not he that mainteined, but he that derided the neceſſity of things was beaten, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that he would infer; And the argument
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169972:49"/> was rather withdrawn than drawn from the ſtory.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> WHether the argument be withdrawn from the ſtory, or the anſwer withdrawn from the argument, let the Reader judge. <hi>T. H.</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes the ſcope of the reaſon, the ſtrength whereof doth not lie, neither in the authority of <hi>Zeno,</hi> a rigid Stoick, which is not worth a button in this cauſe; Nor in the ſervants being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to Stoicall neceſſity, for it appeares not out of the ſtory, that the ſervant did deride ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but rather that he pleaded it in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for his own juſtification. Now in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the fray, we were told even now, that no power doth juſtifie an action, but onely that which is irreſiſtible. Such was not <hi>Zenos.</hi> And therefore it advantageth neither of their cauſes, neither that of <hi>Zeno,</hi> nor this of <hi>T. H.</hi> What if the ſervant had taken the ſtaff out of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hand and beaten him ſoundly, would not the ſame argument have ſerved the man as well as it did the maſter? that the neceſſity of deſtiny did compell him to ſtrike again. Had not <hi>Zeno</hi> ſmarted juſtly for his Paradox? And might not the ſpectators well have taken up the Judges Apothegm, concerning the diſpute between <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> and his Schollar, <hi>An ill egg of an ill bird?</hi> But the ſtrength of this argument lies partly in the ignorance of <hi>Zeno,</hi> that great Champion of neceſſity, and the beggarlineſs of his cauſe, which admitted no defence but with a cudgell. No man (ſaith the ſervant) ought to be beaten
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169972:50"/> for doing that which he is compelled inevitably to do, but I am compelled inevitably to ſteal. The major is ſo evident, that it cannot be denied. If a ſtrong man ſhall take a weak mans hand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, and do violence with it to a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he whoſe hand is forced, is innocent, and he only culpable who compelled him. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was <hi>Zenos</hi> own doctrine; what anſwer made the great patron of deſtiny to his ſervant? very learnedly he denied the concluſion, and cudgelled his ſervant, telling him in effect, that though there was no reaſon why he ſhould be beaten, yet there was a neceſſity why he muſt be beaten. And partly, in the evident abſurdity of ſuch an opinion which deſerves not to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with reaſons, but with rods. There are four things, ſaid the Philoſoher, which ought not to be called into queſtion, Firſt, ſuch things whereof it is wickedneſs to doubt; as whether the ſoul be immortall, whether there be a God, ſuch an one ſhould not be confuted with reaſons, but caſt into the ſea, with a millſtone about his neck, as unworthy to breath the aire, or to behold the light. Secondly, ſuch things as are above the capacity of reaſon; as among Chriſtians, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the holy Trinity. Thirdly, ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as are evidently true; as that two and two are foure in Arithmetick, that the whole is greater than the part in Logick. Fourthly, ſuch things as are obvious to the ſenſes; as whether the ſnow be white. He who denied the heat of the fire, was juſtly ſentenced to be ſcorched with fire; and he that denied motion, to be beaten
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169972:50"/> untill he recanted. So he who denies all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from neceſſitations, ſhould be ſcourged untill he become an humble ſuppliant to him that whips him, and confeſs, that he hath power, either to ſtrike, or to hold his hand.</p>

The Lawes are unjuſt which prohibite that which a man cannot poſſibly ſhun; All conſultations are vain, if every thing be either neceſſary or impoſſible. Who ever deliberated, whether the Sun ſhould riſe to morrow, or whether he ſhould ſail over mountains? It is to no more purpoſe to admoniſh men of underſtanding than fools, children, or madmen, if all things be neceſſary. Praiſes and diſpraiſes, rewards and puniſhments are as vain as they are undeſerved, if there be no liberty. All Councells, Arts, Arms, Books, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, are ſuperfluous and fooliſh, if there be no liberty; In vain we labour, in vain we ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in vain we take Phyſick, in vain we have Tutours to inſtruct us, if all things come to paſs alike, whether we ſleep or wake, whether we be idle or induſtrious, by unalterable neceſſity. But it is ſaid, that though future events be certain, yet they are unknown to us. And therefore we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite, deliberate, admoniſh, praiſe, diſpraiſe, reward, puniſh, ſtudy, labour, and uſe means. Alas, how ſhould our not knowing of the event be a ſufficient motive to us to uſe the means, ſo long as we believe the event is already certainly

Suppoſe it be unknown, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. We cannot hope to alter the courſe of things by our labours; Let the neceſſary cauſes do their work, we have no remedy but patience, and ſhrug up the ſhoulders.

                  <hi>THE ſecond argument is taken from certain inconveniences which he thinks would follow ſuch an opinion. It is true, that ill uſe may be made of it, and therefore your Lordſhip and <hi>J. D.</hi> ought at my requeſt to keep private, that I ſay here of it. But the inconveniences are indeed none; and what uſe ſoever be made of truth, yet truth is truth; and now the queſtion is not what is fit to be preached, but what is true. The firſt inconvenience he ſayes, is this, that Lawes which prohibite any action are then unjuſt. The ſecond, that all conſultations are vain. The third, that admonitions to men of underſtanding are of no more uſe than to fools, children and mad-men. The fourth, that praiſe, diſpraiſe, reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are in vain. The fift, that Councells, Arts, Armes, Books, Inſtruments, Study, Tutours, Medicines are in vain. To which argument expecting I ſhould anſwer by ſaying, that the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the event were enough to make us uſe means, he adds (as it were a reply to my anſwer foreſeen) theſe words. Alas, how ſhould our not knowing the event be a ſufficient motive to make
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169972:51"/> us uſe the means? Wherein he ſaith right, but my anſwer is not that which he expecteth. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, that the neceſſity of an action doth not make the Law which prohibits it unjuſt. To let paſs, that not the neceſſity, but the will to break the Law maketh the action unjuſt, becauſe the Law regardeth the will, and no other precedent cauſes of action. And to let paſs, that no Law can be poſſibly unjuſt, in as much as every man makes by his conſent the Law he is bound to keep, and which conſequently muſt be juſt, unleſs a man can be unjuſt to himſelf; I ſay, what neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe ſoever preceds an action, yet if the action be forbidden, he that doth it willingly may juſtly be puniſht. For inſtance, ſuppoſe the Law on pain of death prohibit ſtealing, and there be a man who by the ſtrength of temptation is neceſſitated to ſteal, and is thereupon put to death, does not this puniſhment deterr others from theſt? is it not a cauſe that others ſteal not? doth it not frame and make their will to juſtice? To make the Law is therefore to make a cauſe of Juſtice, and to neceſſitate juſtice, and conſequently it is no injuſtice to make ſuch a Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The inſtitution of the Law is not to grieve the delinquent for that which is paſſed, and not to be undone, but to make him and others juſt, that els would not be ſo. And reſpecteth not the evill act paſt, but the good to come. In ſo much as without this good intention of future, no paſt Act of a delinquent could juſtifie his killing in the ſight of God. But you will ſay, how is it juſt to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169972:52"/> kill one man to amend another, if what were done were neceſſary? To this I anſwer, that men are juſtly killed, not for that their actions are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, but that they are ſpared and preſerved, becauſe they are not noxious; for where there is no Law, there no killing, nor any thing els can be unjuſt. And by the right of Nature we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, without being unjust, all that is noxious, both beaſts and men. And for beaſts, we kill them juſtly, when we do it in order to our own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet <hi>J. D.</hi> confeſſeth, that their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being only ſpontaneous and not free, are all neceſſitated and determined to that one thing which they ſhall do. For men, when we make So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties or Commonwealths, we lay down our right to kill, excepting in certain caſes, as murther, theft, or other offenſive actions; So that the right which the Commonwealth hath to put a man to death for crimes, is not created by the Law, but remaines from the firſt right of nature, which every man hath to preſerve himſelf, for that the Law doth not take that right away, in caſe of criminalls, who were by Law excepted. Men are not therefore put to death, or puniſhed for that their theft proceedeth from election, but becauſe it was noxious and contrary to mens preſervation, and the puniſhment conducing to the preſervation of the reſt. In as much as to puniſh thoſe that do voluntary hurt, and none els, frameth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mens wills ſuch as men would have them. And thus it is plain, that from neceſſity of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary action cannot be inferred the injuſtice of the Law that forbiddeth it, or of the Magiſtrate that puniſheth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:169972:52"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, I deny that it makes conſultations to be in vain; 'tis the conſultation that cauſeth a man, and neceſſitateth him to chooſe to do one thing rather than another. So that unleſs a man ſay, that cauſe to be in vain, which neceſſitateth the effect, he cannot infer the ſuperfluouſneſs of conſultation out of the neceſſity of the election pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it. But it ſeemes he reaſons thus, If I muſt needs do this rather than that, then I ſhall do this rather than that, though I conſult not at all; which is a falſe propoſition, a falfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and no better than this, If I ſhall live till to morrow, I ſhall live till to morrow, though I run my ſelf through with a ſword to day. If there be a neceſſity that an action ſhall be done, or that any effect ſhall be brought to paſs, it does not therefore follow, that there is nothing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required as a means to bring it to paſs. And therefore when it is determined, that one thing ſhall be choſen before another, 'tis determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo for what cauſe it ſhall be choſen, which cauſe for the moſt part is deliberation or conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And therefore conſultation is not in vain, and indeed the leſs in vain, by how much the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is more neceſſitated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame anſwer is to be given to the third ſuppoſed inconveniency; Namely, that admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in vain, for admonitions are parts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations. The Admonitor being a Counſailer for the time, to him that is admoniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth pretended inconveniency is, that praiſe and diſpraiſe, reward and puniſhment will be in vain. To which I anſwer, that for praiſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169972:53"/> and diſpraiſe, they depend not at all on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the action praiſed or diſpraiſed. For, what is it els to praiſe, but to ſay a thing is good? Good, I ſay for me, or for ſome body els, or for the State and Commonwealth. And what is it to ſay an action is good, but to ſay, it is as I would wiſh, or as another would have it, or according to the will of the State, that is to ſay, according to Law? Does <hi>J. D.</hi> think, that no action can pleaſe me or him, or the Commonwealth, that ſhould proceed from neceſſity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Things may be therefore neceſſary, and yet prayſeworthy, as alſo neceſſary, and yet diſpraiſed, and neither of both in vain, becauſe praiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe, and likewiſe reward and puniſhment, do by example make and conform the will to good or evill. It was a very great praiſe in my opinion, that <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> gives <hi>Cato,</hi> where he ſayes, he was good by nature, <hi>Et quia aliter eſſe non potuit.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fift and ſixt inconvenience, that Councells, Arts, Arms, Books, Inſtruments, Study, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and the like, would be ſuperfluous, the ſame anſwer ſerves that to the former; That is to ſay, that this conſequence, if the effect ſhall neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to paſs, then it ſhall come to paſs without its cauſe, is a falſe one. And thoſe things named, Councells, Arts, Arms, &amp;c. are the cauſes of thoſe effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:169972:53"/>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> NOthing is more familiar with <hi>T. H.</hi> than to decline an argument. But I will put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to form for him. The firſt inconvenience is thus preſſed. Thoſe Lawes are unjuſt and Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, which do preſcribe things abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in themſelves to be done, and puniſh men for not doing of them. But ſuppoſing <hi>T. H.</hi> his opinion of the neceſſity of all things to be true, all Lawes do preſcribe abſolute impoſſibilities to be done, and puniſh men for not doing of them. The former propoſition is ſo clear, that it cannot be denied. Juſt Lawes are the Ordinances of right reaſon, but thoſe Lawes which preſcribe abſolute impoſſibilities, are not the Ordinances of right reaſon. Juſt Lawes are inſtituted for the publick good, but thoſe Lawes which preſcribe abſolute impoſſibilities are not inſtituted for the publick good. Juſt Laws do ſhew unto a man what is to be done, and what is to be ſhunned; But thoſe Lawes which preſcribe impoſſibilities, do not direct a man what he is to do, and what he is to ſhun. The Minor is as evident; for if his opinion be true all actions, all tranſgreſſions are determined ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently inevitably to be done by a naturall and neceſſary flux of extrinſecall cauſes. Yea, even the will of man, and the reaſon it ſelf is thus determined. And therefore whatſoever Laws do preſcribe any thing to be done which is not done, or to be left undone which is done, do preſcribe abſolute impoſſibilities, and puniſh men for not doing of impoſſibilities. In all his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169972:54"/> anſwer there is not one word to this argument, but only to the concluſion. He ſaith, that <hi>not the neceſſity, but the will to break the Law makes the action unjuſt.</hi> I ask what makes the will to break the Law, is it not his neceſſity? What getts he by this? A perverſe will cauſeth injuſtice, and neceſſity cauſeth a perverſe will. He ſaith, <hi>the Law regardeth the will, but not the precedent cauſes of action.</hi> To what propoſition, to what tearm is this anſwer? he neither denies, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth. Firſt, the queſtion here is not what makes actions to be injuſt, but what makes Lawes to be unjuſt. So his anſwer is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. It is likewiſe untrue, for Firſt, that will which the Law regards, is not ſuch a will as <hi>T. H.</hi> imagineth. It is a free will, not a determined, neceſſitated will; a rationall will, not a brutiſh will. Secondly, the Law doth look upon precedent cauſes as well as the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs of the action. If a child before he be ſeven years old, or have the uſe of reaſon, in ſome childiſh quarrell do willingly ſtab another, whereof we have ſeen experience, yet the Law looks not upon it as an act of murther, becauſe there wanted a power to deliberate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently true liberty. Man-ſlaughter may be as voluntary as murther, and commonly more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, becauſe being done in hot blood, there is the leſs reluctation, yet the Law conſiders, that the former is done out of ſome ſudden paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without ſerious deliberation, and the other out of prepenſed malice, and deſire of revenge, and therefore condemnes murther as more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169972:54"/> and more puniſhable than man-ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, <hi>that no Law can poſſibly be unjuſt;</hi> And I ſay, that this is to deny the concluſion, which deſerves no reply; But to give him ſatisfaction, I will follow him in this alſo. If he intended no more, but that unjuſt Lawes are not Genuine Lawes, nor bind to active obedience, becauſe they are not the ordinations of right reaſon, nor inſtituted for the common good, nor preſcribe that which ought to be done, he ſaid truly, but nothing at all to his purpoſe. But if he intend (as he doth) that there are no Lawes <hi>de facto,</hi> which are the ordinances of reaſon erring, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the common hurt, and preſcribing that which ought not to be done, he is much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Law to drown the Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 1.22. <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> Law, that whoſoever did not fall down and worſhip the golden image which he had ſet up, ſhould be caſt into the fiery furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Darius</hi> his Law, that whoſoever ſhould ask a Petition of any God or man, for thirty dayes, ſave of the King, ſhould be caſt into the Den of Lions, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> his Law, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Jewiſh Nation, root &amp; branch, <hi>Eſther</hi> 3.13. The Phariſees Law, that whoſoever confeſſed Chriſt, ſhould be excommunicated, <hi>John</hi> 9.22. were all unjuſt Lawes.</p>
               <p>The ground of this errour is as great an errour it ſelf (Such an art he hath learned of repac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Paradoxes) which is this. That <hi>every man makes by his conſent the Law which he is bound
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169972:55"/> to keep;</hi> If this were true, it would preſerve them, if not from being unjuſt, yet from being injurious: But it is not true. The poſitive Law of God, conteined in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The Law of Nature, written in our hearts by the Finger of God; The Lawes of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who come in by the power of the Sword; The Lawes of our Anceſtors, which were made before we were born, do all oblige us to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them, yet to none of all theſe did we give our actuall conſent. Over and above all theſe exceptions, he builds upon a wrong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that all Magiſtrates at firſt, were elective. The firſt Governors were Fathers of Families; And when thoſe petty Princes could not afford competent protection and ſecurity to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, many of them did reſign their ſeverall and reſpective intereſts into the hands of one joint Father of the Country.</p>
               <p>And though his ground had been true, that all firſt Legiſlators were elective, which is falſe, yet his ſuperſtructure fails, for it was done in hope and truſt, that they would make juſt Laws. If Magiſtrates abuſe this truſt, and deceive the hopes of the people, by making Tyrranicall Lawes, yet it is without their conſent. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent truſt doth not juſtifie the ſubſequent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and abuſes of a Truſtee. He who is duely elected a Legiſlator, may exerciſe his Legiſlative power unduely. The peoples implicite conſent doth not render the Tyrannicall Lawes of their Legiſlators to be juſt.</p>
               <p>But his chiefeſt anſwer is, that <hi>an action for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169972:55"/> though it proceed from neceſſary cauſes, yet if it were done willingly, it may be juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,</hi> which according to his cuſtome he prooves by an inſtance; <hi>A man neceſſitated to ſteal by the ſtrength of temptation, yet if he ſteal wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, is justly put to death.</hi> Here are two things, and both of them untrue.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he failes in his aſſertion. Indeed we ſuffer juſtly for thoſe neceſſities which we our ſelves have contracted by our own fault, but not for extrinſecall, antecedent neceſsities, which were impoſed upon us without our fault. If that Law do not oblige to puniſhment which is not intimated, becauſe the ſubject is invincibly ignorant of it; How much leſs that Law which preſcribes abſolute impoſſibilities, unleſs perhaps invincible neceſſity be not as ſtrong a plea as invincible ignorance. That which he addes, <hi>if it were done willingly,</hi> though it be of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be rightly underſtood, yet in his ſenſe, that is, if a mans <hi>will be not in his own diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>if his willing do not come upon him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, nor according to any thing els in his power,</hi> it weighs not half ſo much as the leaſt feather in all his horſe-load. For if that Law be unjuſt and tyrannicall which commands a man to do that which is impoſſible for him to do, then that Law is likewiſe unjuſt and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, which commands him to will that which is impoſſible for him to will.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, his inſtance ſuppoſeth an untruth, and is a plain begging of the queſtion. No man is extrinſecally, antecedently and irreſiſtibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitated
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169972:56"/> by temptation to ſteal. The Devill may ſollicite us, but he cannot neceſsitate us. He hath a faculty of perſwading, but not a power of compelling. <hi>Nos ignem habemus, ſpiritus flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ciet,</hi> as <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> He blowes the coles, but the fire is our own. <hi>Mordet duntaxat ſeſe in fauces illius objicientem,</hi> as <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> he bites not untill we thruſt our ſelves into his mouth. He may propoſe, he may ſuggeſt, but he cannot moove the will effectively. <hi>Reſiſt the Devill, and he will flie from you,</hi> Jam. 4.7. By faith we are able <hi>to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,</hi> Eph. 6.16. And if Sathan, who can both propoſe the object, and chooſe out the fitteſt times and places, to worke upon our frailties, and can ſuggeſt reaſons, yet cannot neceſſitate the will (which is moſt certain,) then much leſs can outward objects do it alone. They have no naturall efficacy to determine the will. Well may they be occaſions, but they cannot be cauſes of evill. The ſenſitive appetite may engender a proclivity to ſteal, but not a neceſſity to ſteal. And if it ſhould produce a kind of neceſſity, yet it is but Moral, not Natural; Hypothetical, not Abſolute; Coexiſtent, not Antecedent from our ſelves, nor extrinſecall. This neceſſity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proclivity, was free in its cauſes, we our ſelves by our own negligence in not oppoſing our paſſions when we ſhould, and might, have freely given it a kind of dominion over us. Admit that ſome ſudden paſſions may and do extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſurpriſe us; And therefore we ſay, <hi>motus primo primi,</hi> the firſt motions are not always in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169972:56"/> our power, neither are they free, yet this is but very rarely, and it is our own fault that they do ſurpriſe us. Neither doth the Law puniſh the firſt motion to theft, but the adviſed act of ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The intention makes the thief. But of this more largely numb. 25.</p>
               <p>He pleades moreover, <hi>that the Law is a cauſe of juſtice,</hi> that it <hi>frames the wills of men to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and <hi>that the puniſhment of one doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the preſervation of many.</hi> All this is moſt true of a juſt Law juſtly executed. But this is no god-a-mercy to <hi>T. H.</hi> his opinion of abſolute neceſſity. If all actions, and all events be prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Naturaly, Neceſſarily, Extrinſecally, how ſhould the Law frame men morally to good actions? He leaves nothing for the Law to do, but either that which is done already, or that which is impoſſible to be done. If a man be chained to every individual act which he doth, and from every act which he doth not, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolvible bonds of inevitable neceſſity, how ſhould the Law either deterre him or frame him? If a dog be chained faſt to a poſt, the ſight of a rod cannot draw him from it. Make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Lawes, that the fire ſhall not burn, yet it will burn. And whatſoever men do (according to <hi>T. H.)</hi> they do it as neceſſarily, as the fire burneth. Hang up a thouſand Theeves, and if a man be determined inevitably to ſteal, he muſt ſteal notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>He addes, that <hi>the ſufferings impoſed by the Law upon delinquents, reſpect not the evill act paſt, but the good to come,</hi> and that <hi>the putting
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169972:57"/> of a delinquent to death by the Magiſtrate for any crime whatſoever, cannot be juſtified before God, except there be a real intention to benefit others by his example.</hi> The truth is, the puniſhing of delinquents by Law, reſpecteth both the evill act paſt, and the good to come. The ground of it, is the evill act paſt, the ſcope or end of it, is the good to come. The end without the ground cannot juſtifie the act. A bad intention may make a good action bad; but a good intention cannot make a bad action good. It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to do evill, that good may come of it, nor to puniſh an innocent perſon for the admonition of others; that is to fall into a certain crime, for fear of an uncertain. Again, though there were no other end of penalties inflicted, neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batory, nor caſtigatory, nor exemplary, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicatory, to ſatisfie the Law, out of a zeal of Juſtice, by giving to every one his own, yet the action is juſt and warrantable. Killing, as it is conſidered in it ſelf without all undue circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was never prohibited to the lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who is the Vicegerent or Lieutenant of God, from whom he derives his power of life and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. H.</hi> hath one plea more. As a drowning man catcheth at every Bulruſh, ſo he layes hold on every pretence to ſave a deſperate cauſe. But firſt, it is worth our obſervation to ſee how oft he changeth ſhapes in this one particular. Firſt, he told us, that it was the irreſiſtible power of God that juſtifies all his actions, though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand one thing openly, and plot another thing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169972:57"/> ſecretly, though he be the cauſe, not only of the action, but alſo of the irregularity, though he both give man power to act and determine this power to evill, as well as good; though he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Creatures, for doing that which he himſelf did neceſſitate them to do. But being preſſed with reaſon, that this is tyrannical; firſt, to neceſſitate a man to do his will, and then to puniſh him for doing of it, he leaves this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the plain field, and flies to a ſecond. That therefore a man is juſtly puniſhed, for that which he was neceſſitated to do, becauſe the act was voluntary on his part. This hath more ſhew of reaſon than the former, if he did make the will of man to be in his own diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but maintaining, that the will is irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly determined to will whatſoever it doth will, the injuſtice and abſurdity is the ſame; Firſt, to neceſſitate a man to will, and then to puniſh him for willing. The dog onely bites the ſtone which is thrown at him with a ſtrange hand, but they make the firſt cauſe to puniſh the inſtrument, for that which is his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act. Wherefore not being ſatisfied with this, he caſts it off, and flies to his third ſhift. <hi>Men are not puniſhed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>therefore, becauſe their theft proceeded from election</hi> (that is, becauſe it was willingly done, for to Elect and Will, ſaith he, are both one; Is not this to blow hot and cold with the ſame breath?) <hi>but becauſe it was noxious and contrary to mens preſervation.</hi> Thus far he ſaith true, that every creature by the inſtinct of nature, ſeeks to preſerve it ſelf; caſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169972:58"/> water into a duſty place, and it contracts it ſelf into little globes, that is, to preſerve it ſelf. And thoſe who are noxious in the eye of the Law, are juſtly puniſhed by them to whom the execution of the Law is committed; but the Law accounts no perſons noxious, but thoſe who are noxious by their own fault. It puniſheth not a thorn for pricking, becauſe it is the nature of the thorn, and it can do no otherwiſe, nor a child before it have the uſe of reaſon. If one ſhould take mine hand perforce, and give another a box on the ear with it, my hand is noxious, but the Law puniſheth the other who is faulty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath reaſon to propoſe the queſtion, <hi>how it is juſt to kill one man to amend another, if he who killed did nothing but what he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to do.</hi> He might as well demand how it is lawfull to murther a company of innocent Infants to make a bath of their lukewarm blood, for curing the Leproſy. It had been a more rational way; firſt, to have demonſtrated that it is ſo, and then to have queſtioned why it is ſo. His aſſertion it ſelf is but a dream, and the reaſon which he gives of it why it is ſo, is a dream of a dream.</p>
               <p>The ſum of it is this; <hi>That where there is no Law, there no killing or any thing els can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; that before the conſtitution of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths every man had power to kill another, if he conceived him to be hurtfull to him; that at the conſtitution of Commonwealths particular men lay down this right in part, and in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it to themſelves, as in caſe of theft, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169972:58"/> That the right which the Commonwealth hath to put a malefactor to death is not created by the Law, but remaineth from the firſt right of Nature, which every man hath to preſerve himſelf, that the killing of men in this caſe is as the killing of beaſts in order to our own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> This may well be called ſtringing of Paradoxes.</p>
               <p n="1">But firſt, there never was any ſuch time when mankind was without Governors and Lawes, and Societies. Paternall Government was in the world from the beginning, and the Law of Nature. There might be ſometimes a root of ſuch Barbarous Theeviſh Brigants, in ſome rocks, or deſarts, or odd corners of the world, but it was an abuſe and a degeneration from the nature of man, who is a politicall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This ſavage opinion reflects too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the honour of mankind.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, there never was a time when it was lawfull ordinarily for private men to kill one another for their own preſervation. If God would have had men live like wild beaſts, as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Bears or Tygers, he would have armed them with hornes, or tusks, or talons, or pricks; but of all creatures man is born moſt naked, without any weapon to defend himſelf, becauſe God had provided a better means of ſecurity for him, that is, the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, that right which private men have to preſerve themſelves, though it be with the killing of another, when they are ſet upon to be murdered or robbed, is not a remainder or a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169972:59"/> reſerve of ſome greater power which they have reſigned, but a privilege which God hath given them, in caſe of extreme danger and invincible neceſſity, that when they cannot poſſibly have recourſe to the ordinary remedy, that is, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, every man becomes a Magiſtrate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">Fourthly, nothing can give that which it never had; The people, whileſt they were a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed rabble (which in ſome odd caſes might happen to be) never had juftly the power of life and death, and therefore they could not give it by their election. All that they do is to prepare the matter, but it is God Almighty, that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſoul of power.</p>
               <p n="5">Fiftly and laſtly, I am ſorry to hear a man of reaſon and parts to compare the murthering of men with the ſlaughtering of brute beaſts. The elements are for the Plants, the Plants for the brute beaſts, the brute beaſts for man. When God inlarged his former grant to man, and gave him liberty to eat the fleſh of the creatures for his ſuſtenance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.3. Yet man is expreſly excepted, ver. 6. <hi>Who ſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> And the reaſon is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, <hi>for in the Image of God made he man.</hi> Before ſin entred into the world, or before any creatures were hurtfull, or noxious to man, he had dominion over them, as their Lord and Maſter. And though the poſſeſſion of this ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty be loſt in part, for the ſin of man, which made not onely the creatures to rebell, but alſo the inferiour faculties, to rebell againſt the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169972:59"/> from whence it comes, that one man is hurtfull to another, yet the dominion ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines; wherein we may obſerve how ſweetly the providence of God doth temper this croſs, that though the ſtrongeſt creatures have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn their obedience, as Lions and Beares, to ſhew that man hath loſt the excellency of his dominion, and the weakeſt creatures, as Flies and Gnats, to ſhew into what a degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he is fallen, yet ſtill the moſt profitable and uſefull creatures, as Sheep and Oxen, do in ſome degree retain their obedience.</p>
               <p>The next branch of his anſwer concernes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, <hi>which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are not ſuperfluous, though all things come to paſs neceſſarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the cauſe which doth neceſſitate the effect, and the means to bring it to paſs.</hi> We were told <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. that the laſt dictate of right reaſon was but as the laſt feather which breaks the horſes back. It is well, yet that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath gained ſome command again, and is become at leaſt a Quarter-maſter. Certainly if any thing under God have power to determin the will, it is right reaſon. But I have ſhewed ſufficiently, that reaſon doth not determine the will Phyſically, nor abſolutely, much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally, and antecedently, and therefore it makes nothing for that neceſſity which <hi>T. H.</hi> hath undertaken to prove. He adds further, that <hi>as the end is neceſſary, ſo are the means; And when it is determined, that one thing ſhall be choſen before another, it is determined alſo for what cauſe it ſhall be ſo choſen.</hi> All which is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169972:60"/> truth, but not the whole truth; for as God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines means for all ends, ſo he adapts and fitts the means to their reſpective ends, free means to free ends, contingent means to contingent ends, neceſſary means to neceſſary ends. Whereas <hi>T. H.</hi> would have all means, all ends, to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. If good hath ſo ordered the world, that a man ought to uſe and may freely uſe thoſe means of God, which he doth neglect, not by vertue of Gods decree, but by his own fault; If a man uſe thoſe means of evill, which he ought not to uſe, and which by Gods decree, he had power to forbear; If God have left to man in part the free managery of human affaires, and to that purpoſe hath endowed him with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, then conſultations are of uſe, then provident care is needfull, then it concerns him to uſe the means. But if God have ſo ordered this world, that a man cannot, if he would, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect any means of good, which by vertue of Gods decree it is poſſible for him to uſe, and that he cannot poſſibly uſe any means of evill, but thoſe which are irreſiſtibly and inevitably impoſed upon him by an antecedent decree, then not only conſultations are vain, but that noble faculty of reaſon it ſelf is vain: do we think that we can help God Almighty to do his proper work? In vain we trouble our ſelves, in vain we take care to uſe thoſe means, which are not in our power to uſe, or not to uſe. And this is that which was conteined in my prolepſis or prevention of his anſwer, though he be pleaſed both to diſorder it, and to ſilence it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169972:60"/> hope by our labours, to alter the courſe of things ſet down by God; let him perform his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, let the neceſſary cauſes do their work. If we be thoſe cauſes, yet we are not in our own diſpoſition, we muſt do what we are ordained to do, and more we cannot do. Man hath no remedy but patience, and ſhrug up the ſhoulders. This is the doctrine flowes from this opinion of abſolute neceſſity. Let us ſuppoſe the great wheel of the clock which ſetts all the little wheels a going, to be as the decree of God, and that the motion of it were perpetual infallible from an intrinſecal principle, even as Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is Infallible, Eternal, All-ſufficient. Let us ſuppoſe the leſſer wheels to be the ſecond cauſes, and that they do as certainly follow the motion of the great wheel, without miſſing or ſwerving in the leaſt degree, as the ſecond cauſes do purſue the determination of the firſt cauſe. I deſire to know in this caſe what cauſe there is to call a Councell of Smiths, to conſult and order the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which was ordered and determined before their hands. Are men wiſer than God? yet all men know, that the motion of the leſſer whee is is a neceſſary means to make the clock ſtrike.</p>
               <p>But he tells me in great ſadneſs, that <hi>my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is juſt like this other; If I ſhall live till to morrow, I ſhall live till to morrow, though I run my ſelf through with a ſword to day, which ſaith he, is a falſe conſequence, and a falſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi> Truly, if by running through, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands killing, it is a falſe, or rather a fooliſh
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169972:61"/> propoſition, and implyes a contradiction. To live till to morrow, and to day to dy, are inconſiſtent. But by his favour, this is not my conſequence, but this is his own opinion. He would perſwade us, that it is abſolutely neceſſary, that a man ſhall live till to morrow, and yet that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he may kill himſelf to day. My Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this. If there be a liberty and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for a man to kill himſelf to day, then it is not abſolutely neceſſary, that he ſhall live till to morrow; but there is ſuch a liberty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſuch neceſſity. And the conſequence which I make here is this. If it be abſolutely neceſſary, that a man ſhall live till to morrow, then it is vain and ſuperfluous for him to conſult and deliberate, whether he ſhould dy to day, or not. And this is a true conſequence; The ground of his miſtake is this, that though it be true, that a man may kill himſelf to day, yet upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his abſolute neceſſity it is impoſſible. Such Heterogeneous arguments and inſtances he produceth, which are half builded upon our true grounds, and the other half upon his falſe grounds.</p>
               <p>The next branch of my argument concerns Admonitions, to which he gives no new anſwer, and therefore I need not make any new reply; ſaving only to tell him, that he miſtakes my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; I ſay not only, If all things be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then admonitions are in vain, but if all things be neceſſary, then it is to no more purpoſe to admoniſh men of underſtanding than fools, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or mad-men. That they do admoniſh the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169972:61"/> one and not the other, is confeſſedly true; and no reaſon under heaven can be given for it but this, that the former have the uſe of reaſon, and true liberty, with a dominion over their own actions, which children, fools and mad-men have not.</p>
               <p>Concerning praiſe and diſpraiſe, he inlargeth himſelf. The ſcope of his diſcourſe is, that <hi>things neceſſary may be praiſe-worthy.</hi> There is no doubt of it, but withall their praiſe reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the free agent, as the praiſe of a ſtatue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon the workman who made it. <hi>To praiſe a thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to ſay, it is good.</hi> True, but this goodneſs is not a Metaphyſicall goodneſs, ſo the worſt of things, and whatſoever hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is good. Nor a natural goodneſs; The praiſe of it paſſeth wholy to the Author of Nature; God ſaw all that he had made, and it was very good. But a morall goodneſs, or a goodneſs of actions rather than of things. The morall goodneſs of an action is the conformity of it with right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The morall evill of an action, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of it, and the alienation of it from right reaſon. It is morall praiſe and diſpraiſe which we ſpeak of here. To praiſe any thing morally, is to ſay, it is morally good, that is, conformable to right reaſon. The morall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe of a thing is to ſay, it is morally bad, or diſagreeing from the rule of right reaſon. So mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall praiſe is from the good uſe of liberty, morall diſpraiſe from the bad uſe of liberty: but if all things be neceſſary, than morall liberty is quite taken away, and with it all true praiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe. Whereas <hi>T. H.</hi> adds, that <hi>to ſay a thing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169972:62"/> is good, is to ſay, it is as I would wiſh, or as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other would wiſh, or as the State would have it, or according to the Law of the Land,</hi> he miſtakes infinitely. He and another, and the State, may all wiſh, that which is not really good, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in appearance. We do often wiſh what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, or delightfull, without regarding ſo much as we ought what is honeſt. And though the will of the State where we live, or the Law of the Land do deſerve great conſideration, yet it is no infallible rule of morall goodneſs. And therefore to his queſtion, <hi>whether nothing that proceeds from neceſſity can pleaſe me,</hi> I anſwer, yes. The burning of the fire pleaeth me when I am cold; And I ſay, it is good fire, or a creature created by God, for my uſe, and for my good: Yet I do not mean to attribute any morall goodneſs to the fire, nor give any morall praiſe to it, as if it were in the power of the fire it ſelf, either to communicate its heat, or to ſuſpend it, but I praiſe firſt the Creator of the fire, and then him who provided it. As for the praiſe which <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius Paterculus</hi> gives <hi>Cato,</hi> that he was good by nature. <hi>Et quia aliter eſſe non potuit,</hi> it hath more of the Oratour than either of the Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian or Philoſopher in it. Man in the State of innocency did fall and become evill, what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege hath <hi>Cato</hi> more than he? No, by his leave. <hi>Narratur &amp; dij Catonis ſaepe mero caluiſſe virtus.</hi> but the true meaning is, that he was naturally of a good temper, not ſo prone to ſome kinds of vices as others were; This is to praiſe a thing, not an action, naturally, not morally. <hi>Socrates</hi> was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169972:62"/> not of ſo good a naturall temper, yet prooved as good a man; the more his praiſe, by how much the difficulty was the more to conform his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly appetite to right reaſon.</p>
               <p>Concerning reward and puniſhment, he ſaith not a word, but onely that they frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the will to good, which hath been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently anſwered. They do ſo indeed, but if his opinion were true, they could not do ſo. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my aim is not only to anſwer <hi>T. H.</hi> but alſo to ſatisfie my ſelf; Though it be not urged by him, yet I do acknowledge, that I find ſome improper and analogicall rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed to brute beaſts, as the hunter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his dog, the maſter of the Coy-duck whipps her, when ſhe returns without company. And if it be true, which he affirmeth a little before, that I have confeſſed, that <hi>the actions of brute beaſts are all neceſſitated and determined to that one thing which they ſhall do,</hi> the difficulty is increaſed.</p>
               <p n="1">But firſt, my ſaying is miſalleged. I ſaid, that ſome kinds of actions which are moſt excellent in brute beaſts, and make the greateſt ſhew of reaſon, as the Bees working their Honey, and the Spiders weaving their Webbs, are yet done without any conſultation, or deliberation, by a meer inſtinct of nature, and by a determination of their fancies, to theſe only kinds of workes But I did never ſay, I could not ſay, that all their individuall actions are neceſſary, and antecedently determined in their cauſes, as what dayes the Bees ſhall flie abroad, and what dayes and houres each Bee ſhall keep in the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169972:63"/> Hive, how often they ſhall fetch in Thyme on a day, and from whence. Theſe actions and the like, though they be not free, becauſe brute beaſts want reaſon to deliberate, yet they are contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and therefore not neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, I do acknowledge, that as the fancies of ſome brute creatures are determined by nature, to ſome rare &amp; exquiſite works; So in others, where it finds a naturall propenſion; Art which is the Imitator of Nature, may frame &amp; form them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the Artiſt, to ſome particular actions and ends, as we ſee in Setting-doggs, and Coy-ducks, and Parrots; and the principall means whereby they effect this, is by their backs, or by their bellies, by the rod, or by the morſell, which have indeed a ſhadow, or reſemblance of rewards and puniſhments. But we take the word here properly, not as it is uſed by vulgar people, but as it is uſed by Divines and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, for that recompenſe which is due to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and diſhoneſt actions. Where there is no morall liberty, there is neither honeſty nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, neither true reward nor puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, when brute creatures do learn any ſuch qualities, it is not out of judgment, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, or diſcourſe, by inferring or concluding one thing from another, which they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. Neither are they able to conceive a reaſon of what they do, but meerly out of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or out of a ſenſitive fear, or hope. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when they did after one manner, they were beaten; and when they did after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, they were cheriſhed, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169972:63"/> they apply themſelves. But if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall actions were abſolutely neceſſary, fear or hope could not alter them. Moſt certainly, if there be any deſert in it, or any praiſes due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it is to them who did inſtruct them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, concerning Arts, Arms, Books, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Study, Phyſick, and the like, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth not a word more than what is already ſatisfied. And therefore I am ſilent.</p>

Who will bewaile his ſinns with teares? what will become of that Grief, that Zeal, that Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that holy Revenge, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, if men be once throughly perſuaded that they could not ſhun what they did? A man may grieve for that which he could not help, but he will never be brought to bewall, that as his own fault, which flowed not from his own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but from an antecedent neceſſity. Who will be carefull or ſollicitous to perform obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that believeth, there are inevitable bounds and limits ſet to all his devotions, which he can neither go beyond, nor come ſhort of? To what end ſhall he pray God to avert thoſe evills which are inevitable? or to confer thoſe favours which are impoſſible? We indeed know not what good or evill ſhall happen to us, but this we know, that if all things be neceſſary, our devotions and indeavours cannot alter that which muſt be.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169972:64"/> In a word, the onely reaſon why thoſe perſons who tread in this path of fatall deſtiny do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pray, or repent, or ſerve God, is becauſe the light of nature and the ſtrength of reaſon, and the evidence of Scripture, do for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tranſport them from their ill choſen grounds, and expell thoſe Stociall fancies out of their heads; A complete Stoick can neither pray, nor repent, nor ſerve God to any purpoſe.

                  <hi>HIs third Argument conſiſteth in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which he ſaith will follow, namely, impiety &amp; neglicence of Religious duties, repentance and zeal to Gods ſervice. To which I anſwer, as to the reſt, that they follow not. I muſt confeſs, if we conſider far the greateſt part of mankind, not as they ſhould be, but as they are, that is, as men whom either the ſtudy of acquiring wealth, or preferments, or whom the appetite of ſenſuall delights, or the impatience of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or the raſh imbracing of wrong principles, have made unapt to diſcuſs the truth of things, that the diſpute of this queſtion will rather hurt than help their piety. And therefore, if he had not deſired this anſwer, I would not have written it. Nor do I write it, but in hope your Lordſhip, and he will keep it in private. Nevertheleſs in very truth, the neceſſity of events does not of it ſelf draw with it any impiety at all. For piety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth onely in two things; One, that we honour God in our hearts, which is, that we think of his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169972:64"/> power as highly as we can, for to honour any thing is nothing els but to think it to be of great power. The other, that we ſignifie that honour and eſteem by our words and actions, which is called <hi>cultus,</hi> or worſhip of God. He therefore that thinketh that all things proceed from Gods Eternall Will, and conſequently are neceſſary, does he not think God Omnipotent? does he not eſteem of his power as highly as poſſible? which is to honour God as much as can be in his heart. Again, he that thinketh ſo, is he not more apt by externall acts and words to acknowledge it, then he that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth otherwiſe? Yet is this externall acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſame thing which we call worſhip. So this opinion fortifieth piety in both kinds, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, internally, and therefore is far from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And for repentance, which is nothing but a glad returning into the right way, after the grief of being out of the way, though the cauſe that made him go aſtray were neceſſary, yet there is no reaſon why he ſhould not grieve; and again, though the cauſe why he returned into the way were neceſſary, there remaines ſtill the cauſes of joy. So that the neceſſity of the actions taketh away neither of thoſe parts of repentance, grief for the errour, nor joy for the returning. And for prayer, whereas he ſaith, that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of things deſtroyes prayer, I deny it. For though prayer be none of the cauſes that moove Gods will, his will being unchangeable, yet ſince we find in Gods Word, he will not give his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings but to thoſe that ask them, the motive to prayer is the ſame. Prayer is the gift of God, no
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169972:65"/> leſs than the bleſſings. And the prayer is decreed together in the ſame decree wherein the bleſſing is decreed. Tis manifeſt, that thanksgiving is no cauſe of the bleſſing paſt; And that which is paſt is ſure, and neceſſary. Yet even amongſt men, thanks is in uſe as an acknowledgment of the benefit paſt, though we ſhould expect no new benefit for our gratitude. And prayer to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is but thanksgiving for his bleſſings in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; and though it precede the particular thing we ask, yet it is not a cauſe or means of it, but a ſignification that we expect nothing but from God, in ſuch manner as he, not as we will. And our Saviour by word of mouth bids us pray, Thy will, not our will be done, and by example teaches us the ſame, for he prayed thus, <hi>Father, if it be thy will, let this cup paſs, &amp;c.</hi> The end of prayer, as of thanksgiving, is not to move, but to honour God Almighty, in acknowledging that what we ask can be effected by him only.</hi>

                  <label>J. D.</label> I Hope <hi>T. H.</hi> will be perſuaded in time, that it is not the Covetouſneſs, or Ambition, or Senſuallity, or Sloth, or Prejudice of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which renders this doctrine of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity dangerous, but that it is in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſtructive to true godlineſs; And though his anſwer conſiſt more of oppoſitions than of ſolutions, yet I will not willingly leave one grain of his matter unweighed. Firſt, he erres in making inward piety to conſiſt meerly in the eſtimation of the judgment. If this were ſo, what hinders but that the Devills ſhould have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169972:65"/> as much inward piety as the beſt Chriſtians, for they eſteem Gods power to be infinite, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Though inward piety do ſuppoſe the act of the underſtanding, yet it conſiſteth properly in the act of the will, being that branch of Juſtice which gives to God the honor which is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Is there no Love due to God, no Faith, no Hope? Secondly, he erres in making inward piety to aſcribe no glory to God, but only the glory of his Power or Omnipotence. What ſhall become of all other the divine attributes, and particularly of his Goodneſs, of his Truth, of his Juſtice, of his mercy, which beget a more true and ſincere honour in the heart than great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf? <hi>Magnos facile laudamus, bonos lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benter.</hi> Thirdly, this opinion of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity deſtroyes the truth of God, making him to command one thing openly, and to neceſſitate another privately, to chide a man for doing that which it hath determined him to do, to profeſs one thing, and to intend another. It deſtroyes the goodneſs of God, making him to be an hater of mankind, and to delight in the torments of his creatures, whereas the very doggs licked the ſores of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in pitty and commiſeration of him. It deſtroyes the Juſtice of God, making him to puniſh the creatures for that which was his own act, which they had no more power to ſhun, than the fire hath power not to burn. It deſtroyes the very power of God, making him to be the true Author of all the defects and evills which are in the world. Theſe are the fruits of Impotence, not of Omnipotence. He who is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169972:66"/> the effective cauſe of ſin either in himſelfe, or in the Creature, is not Almighty. There needs no other Devill in the world to raiſe jealouſies and ſuſpitions between God and his creatures, or to poiſon mankind with an apprehenſion, that God doth not love them, but onely this opinion, which was the office of the Serpent <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. Fourthly, for the outward worſhip of God. How ſhall a man praiſe God for his goodneſs, who believes him to be a greater Tyrant than ever was in the world? who creates millions to burn eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally without their fault, to expreſs his power? How ſhall a man hear the Word of God with that reverence, and devotion, and faith, which is requiſite, who believeth that God cauſeth his Goſpel to be preached to the much greater part of Chriſtians, not with any intention that they ſhould be converted and ſaved, but meerly to harden their hearts, and to make them inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable? How ſhall a man receive the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with comfort and confidence, as a Seal of Gods love in Chriſt, who believeth, that ſo many millions are poſitively excluded from all fruit and benefit of the Paſſions of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had done either good or evill? How ſhall he prepare himſelf with care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, who apprehendeth, that Eating and Drinking unworthily is not the cauſe of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but becauſe God would damn a man, therefore he neceſſitates him to eat and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily? How ſhall a man make a free vow to God, without groſs ridiculous hypocriſy, who thinks he is able to perform nothing, but as he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169972:66"/> is extrinſecally neceſſitated? Fiftly, for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, how ſhall a man condemn and accuſe himſelf for his ſins, who thinks himſelf to be like a Watch which is wound up by God, and that he can go neither longer nor ſhorter, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nor ſlower, truer nor falſer, than he is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God? If God ſets him right, he goes right. If God ſet him wrong, he goes wrong. How can a man be ſaid to return into the right way, who never was in any other way, but that which God himſelf had chalked out for him? What is his purpoſe to amend, who is deſtitute of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but as if a man ſhould purpoſe to fly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wings, or a begger who hath not a groat in his purſe, purpoſe to build Hoſpitalls?</p>
               <p>We uſe to ſay, admit one abſurdity, and a thouſand will follow. To maintain this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable opinion of abſolute neceſſity he is neceſſitated (but it is hypothetically, he might change his opinion, if he would) to deal with all antient Writers, as the <hi>Goths</hi> did with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who deſtroyed all their magnificent works, that there might remain no monument of their greatneſs upon the face of the earth. Therefore he will not leave ſo much as one of their opinions, nor one of their definitions, nay, not one of their tearmes of Art ſtanding. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a deſcription he hath given us here of Repentance. <hi>It is a glad returning into the right way, after the grief of being out of the way.</hi> It amazed me to find <hi>gladneſs</hi> to be the firſt word in the deſcription of repentance. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not that repentance, nor his piety
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169972:67"/> that piety, nor his prayer that kind of prayer which the Church of God in all Ages hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. Faſting, and Sackcloth, and Aſhes, and Teares, and <hi>Humi-cubations,</hi> uſed to be companions of Repentance. Joy may be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of it, not a part of it. It is a <hi>returning,</hi> but whoſe act is this returning? Is it Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or doth the penitent perſon concur alſo freely with the grace of God? If it be Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, then it is his repentance, not mans repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, what need the penitent perſon trouble himſelf about it? God will take care of his own work. The Scriptures teach us otherwiſe, that God expects our concurrence. Revel. 3.19. <hi>Be zealous and repent, behold I ſtand at the dore, and knock. If any man hear my voyce, and open the dore, I will come in to him.</hi> It is a <hi>glad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into the right way.</hi> Why dare any more call that a wrong way, which God himſelf hath determined? He that willeth, and doth that which God would have him to will and to do, is never out of his right way. It followes in his deſcription, <hi>after the grief, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, a man may grieve for that which is neceſſarily impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon him, but he cannot grieve for it as a fault of his own, if it never was in his power to ſhun it; Suppoſe a Writing-maſter ſhall hold his Scholars hand in his, and write with it; the Scholars part is only to hold ſtill his hand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Maſter write well or ill; the Scholar hath no ground, either of joy or ſorrow as for himſelf, no man will interpret it to be his act, but his Maſters. It is no fault to be out of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169972:67"/> right way, if a man had not liberty to have kept himſelf in the way.</p>
               <p>And ſo from <hi>Repentance</hi> he skipps quite over <hi>New obedience,</hi> to come to Prayer, which is the laſt Religious duty inſiſted upon by me here. But according to his uſe, without either anſwering or mentioning what I ſay. Which would have ſhewed him plainely what kind of prayer I intend, not contemplative prayer in generall, as it includes thankſgiving, but that moſt proper kind of prayer which we call <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which uſed to be thus defined, to be an <hi>act of Religion by which we deſire of God ſomething which we have not, and hope that we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by him.</hi> Quite contrary to this <hi>T. H.</hi> tells us, that prayer <hi>is not a cauſe, nor a meanes of Gods bleſſing, but only a ſignification that we expect it from him.</hi> If he had told us onely that prayer is not a meritorious cauſe of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as the poor man by begging an almes doth not deſerve it, I ſhould have gone along with him. But to tell us, that it is not ſo much as a means to procure Gods bleſſing, and yet with the ſame breath, that <hi>God will not give his bleſſings, but to thoſe who pray,</hi> who ſhall recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile him to himſelf? The Scriptures teach us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you,</hi> John 16.23. <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you,</hi> Matth. 7.7. <hi>St. Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. that he was <hi>helped by their prayers,</hi> thats not all, that <hi>the gift was beſtowed upon him by their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169972:68"/> means,</hi> So prayer is a <hi>means;</hi> And <hi>St. James</hi> ſaith, cap. 5.16. <hi>The effectuall fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> If it be <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,</hi> then it is a cauſe. To ſhew this efficacy of prayer, our Saviour uſeth the compariſon of a Father towards his Child, of a Neighbour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Neighbour, yea, of an unjuſt Judge, to ſhame thoſe who think, that God hath not more compaſſion than a wicked man. This was ſignified by <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſtling and prevailing with God. Prayer is like the Tradeſmans tools wherewithall he gets his living for himſelf, and his family. But, ſaith he, <hi>Gods will is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> What then? He might as well uſe this againſt ſtudy, Phyſick, and all ſecond cauſes, as againſt Prayer. He ſhewes even in this, how little they attribute to the endeavours of men. There is a great difference between theſe two, <hi>mutare voluntatem,</hi> to change the will, which God never doth, in whom there is not the leaſt ſhadow of turning by change; His will to love and hate, was the ſame from eternity, which it now is, and ever ſhall be. His love and hatred are immovable, but we are removed, <hi>Non tellus cymbam tellurem cymba reliquit,</hi> And <hi>velle mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem,</hi> to will a change, which God often doth. To change the will argues a change in the Agent, but to will a change, only argues a change in the object. It is no inconſtancy in a man to love or to hate, as the object is changed. <hi>Praeſta mihi omnia eadem &amp; idem ſum.</hi> Prayer works not upon God, but us; It renders not him more propitious in himſelf, but us more capable
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169972:68"/> of mercy. He ſaith, this, <hi>That God doth not bleſs us, except we pray, is a motive to prayer.</hi> Why talks he of motives, who acknowledgeth no liberty, nor admitts any cauſe, but abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary? He ſaith, <hi>Prayer is the gift of God, no leſs than the bleſſing which we pray for, and conteined in the ſame decree with the bleſſing.</hi> It is true, the ſpirit of prayer is the gift of God, will he conclude from thence, that the good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of one talent, or of one gift of God, may not procure another? Our Saviour teacheth us otherwiſe, <hi>Come thou good and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, thou haſt been faithfull in little, I will make thee ruler over much.</hi> Too much light is an enemy to the light, and too much Law is an enemy to Juſtice. I could wiſh we wrangled leſs about Gods Decrees, untill we underſtood them better. But, ſaith he, Thankſgiving is no cauſe of the bleſſing paſt, and prayer is but a thankſgiving. He might even as well tell me, that when a beggar craves an almes, and when he gives thanks for it, it is all one. Every thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving is a kind of prayer, but every prayer, and namely Petition, is not a thankſ-giving. In the laſt place he urgeth, that <hi>in our prayers we are bound, to ſubmit our wills to Gods Will,</hi> who ever made any doubt of this, we muſt ſubmit to the Preceptive will of God, or his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we muſt ſubmit to the effective Will of God, when he declares his good pleaſure by the event or otherwiſe. But we deny, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny again, either that God wills things, <hi>ad extra,</hi> without himſelf neceſſarily, or that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169972:69"/> it is his pleaſure that all ſecond cauſes ſhould act neceſſarily at all times, which is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and that which he allegeth to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comes not neer it.</p>

                  <hi>THE fourth Argument from reaſon is this, The Order, Beauty and Perfection of the world requireth, that in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, ſhould be Agents of all ſorts, ſome neceſſary, ſome free, ſome contingent.

               <p>
                  <hi>In which Argument I obſerve, firſt, a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For, ſeeing he that maketh any thing in that he maketh it, he maketh it to be neceſſary, it followeth, that he that maketh all things, maketh all things neceſſary to be. As if a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man make a garment, the garment muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be. So if God make every thing, every thing muſt neceſſarily be. Perhaps the beauty of the world requireth (though we know it not) that ſome Agents ſhould work without deliberation,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169972:69"/> which he calls neceſſary Agents. And ſome Agents with deliberation, and thoſe, both he and I, call free Agents. And that ſome Agents ſhould work, and we not know how; And them effects we both call contingent; But this hinders not, but that he that electeth may have his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction neceſſarily determined to one by former cauſes; And that which is contingent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Fortune, be nevertheleſs neceſſary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on precedent neceſſary cauſes. For by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, men do not mean that which hath no cauſe, but which hath not for cauſe any thing which we perceive. As for example; when a Travailer meets with a ſhower, the journey had a cauſe, and the rain had a cauſe ſufficient enough to produce it, but becauſe the journey cauſed not the rain, nor the rain the journey, we ſay, they were contingent one to another. And thus you ſee, though there be three ſorts of events, Neceſſary, Contingent, and Free, yet they may be all neceſſary, without the deſtruction of the beauty or perfection of the Univers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THE firſt thing he obſerves in mine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is contradiction, as he calls it, but in truth it is but a deception of the ſight. As one candle ſometimes ſeems to be two, or a rod in the water ſhewes to be two rods, <hi>Quicquid reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur, recipitur ad modum recipient is.</hi> But what is this contradiction? Becauſe I ſay, <hi>he who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things, doth not make them neceſſary.</hi> What a contradiction, and but one propoſition? That were ſtrange. I ſay, God hath not made
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169972:70"/> all Agents neceſſary, he ſaith, God hath made all Agents neceſſary. Here is a contradiction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but it is between him and me, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my ſelf. But yet though it be not a formall contradiction, yet perhaps it may imply a contradiction <hi>in adjecto.</hi> Wherefore to clear the matter, and diſpell the miſt which he hath raiſed; It is true, that every thing when it is made, it is neceſſary that it be made ſo as it is, that is, by a neceſſity of infallibility, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſuppoſing, that it be ſo made, but this is not that abſolute, antecedent neceſſity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the queſtion is between him and me. As to uſe his own inſtance; Before the Garment be made, the Tailor is free to make it, either of the <hi>Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> faſhion indifferently: But after it is made, it is neceſſary that it be of that faſhion whereof he hath made it, that is by a neceſſity of ſuppoſition. But this doth neither hinder the cauſe from being a free cauſe, nor the effect from being a free effect, but the one did produce freely, and the other was freely produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. So the contradiction is vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond part of his anſwer he grants, that there are ſome free Agents, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Agents, and that perhaps the beauty of the world doth require it, but like a ſhrewd Cow, which after ſhe hath given her milk, caſts it down with her foot, in the concluſion he tells us, that nevertheleſs they are all neceſſary. This part of his anſwer is a meer Logomachy, (as a great part of the controverſies in the world are) or a contention about words. What is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169972:70"/> of <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and free, and contingent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I have ſhewed before what free and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, do properly ſignifie, but he miſrecites it. He ſaith, I make all Agents which want delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be neceſſary, but I acknowledge that many of them are contingent. Neither do I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove his definition of contingents, though he ſay, I concur with him, that they are <hi>ſuch agents as work we know not how.</hi> For according to this deſcription many neceſſary actions ſhould be contingent, and many contingent actions ſhould be neceſſary. The Loadſtone draweth Iron, the Jet chaff, we know not how, and yet the effect is neceſſary, and ſo it is in all Sympathies and Antipathies or occult qualities. Again, a man walking in the ſtreets, a Tile falls down from an houſe, and breaks his head. We know all the cauſes, we know how this came to paſs. The man walked that way, the pin failed, the Tile fell juſt when he was under it; And yet this is a contingent effect. The man might not have walked that way, and then the Tile had not fallen upon him. Neither yet do I underſtand here in this place by contingents, ſuch events as happen beſides the ſcope, or intention of the Agents; as when a man digging to make a grave, finds a Treaſure, though the word be ſometimes ſo taken. But by contingents, I underſtand all things which may be done, and may not be done, may happen or may not happen, by reaſon of the in determination, or accidentall concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the cauſes. And thoſe ſame things which are abſolutely Incontingent and yet Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetically
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169972:71"/> neceſſary. As ſuppoſing the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger did walk juſt that way, juſt at that time, and that the pin did fail juſt then, and the Tile fall, it was neceſſary that it ſhould fall upon the Paſſengers head.

Now when I ſay the action was neceſſary, I do not ſay it was done againſt the will of the doer, but with his will, and ſo neceſſarily, becauſe mans will, that is, every act of the will, and purpoſe of man had a ſufficient and therefore a neceſſary cauſe, and conſequently every voluntary action was neceſſitated. An a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therefore may be voluntary and a ſin, and nevertheleſs be neceſſary. And becauſe God may afflict by right derived from his Omnipotency, though ſin were not.

That opinion which takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the formall reaſon of ſin, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſin it ſelf, is not to be approoved; this is cleer, becauſe both Reaſon and Religion, Nature, and Scripture do proove, and the whole world confeſſeth, that there is ſin. But this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the neceſſity of all things, by reaſon of a conflux of ſecond cauſes, ordered and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the firſt cauſe, doth take away the very formall reaſon of ſin; This is prooved thus. That which makes ſin it ſelf to be good, and juſt, and lawfull, takes away the formall cauſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the eſſence of ſin; for if ſin be good, and juſt, and lawfull, it is no more evill, it is no ſin, no anomy. But this opinion of the neceſſity of all things, makes ſin to be very good and juſt, and lawfull; for nothing can flow eſſentially by way of Phyſicall determination from the firſt cauſe, which is the Law and Rule of Goodneſs and Juſtice, but that which is good, and juſt, and lawfull, but this opinion makes ſin to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed eſſentially by way of Phyſicall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the firſt cauſe, as appeares in <hi>T. H.</hi> his whole diſcourſe. Neither is it materiall at all, whether it proceed immediatly from the firſt cauſe, or mediately, ſo as it be by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary flux of ſecond and determinate cauſes which produce it inevitably. To theſe proofs he anſwers nothing, but onely by denying the firſt conſequence, as he calls it, and then ſings over his old ſong, <hi>That the nature of ſin conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169972:72"/> in this, that the action proceeds from our will, and be againſt the Law,</hi> which in our ſenſe is moſt true, if he underſtand a juſt Law, and a free rationall will; But ſuppoſing (as he doth) that the Law injoines things impoſſible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be done, then it is an unjuſt and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall Law, and the tranſgreſſion of it is no ſin, not to do that which never was in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to do. And ſuppoſing likewiſe (as he doth) that the will is inevitably determined by ſpeciall influence from the firſt cauſe, then it is not mans will, but Gods Will, and flowes eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from the Law of Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>That which he addes of a Judge, is altogether impertinent, as to his defence. Neither is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Judge the proper Judge, nor the Law of the Land the proper Rule of Sin. But it makes ſtrongly againſt him; for the Judge goes upon a good ground, and even this which he confeſſeth, that the <hi>Judge looks at no higher cauſe, then the will of the doer,</hi> prooves, that the will of the doer did determine it ſelf freely, and that the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor had liberty to have kept the Law, if he would: Certainly, a Judge ought to look at all materiall circumſtances, and much more at all eſſentiall cauſes. Whether every ſufficient cauſe be a neceſſary cauſe, will come to be examined more properly, Numb. 31. For the preſent, it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that liberty flowes from the ſufficiency, and contingency from the debility of the cauſe. Nature never intends the generation of a monſter. If all the cauſes concur ſufficiently, a perfect creature is produced, but by reaſon of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169972:73"/> the inſufficiency, or debility, or contingent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berration of ſome of the cauſes, ſometimes a Monſter is produced. Yet the cauſes of a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter were ſufficient for the production of that which was produced, that is a Monſter, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Monſter had not been produced. What is it then? A Monſter is not produced by vertue of that order which is ſet in Nature, but by the contingent aberration of ſome of the naturall cauſes in their concurrence. The order ſet in Nature, is, that every like ſhould beget its like. But ſuppoſing the concurrence of the cauſes to be ſuch as it is, in the generation of a Monſter, the generation of a Monſter is neceſſary; as all the events in the world are when they are, that is, by an hypotheticall neceſſity. Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to his old help, that God may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh by right of omnipotence, though there were no ſin. The queſtion is not now what God may do, but what God will do, according to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which he hath made with man, <hi>Fac hoc &amp; vives,</hi> Do this and thou ſhalt live, whether God doth puniſh any man contrary to this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thy deſtruction is from thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> He that wills not the death of a Sinner, doth much leſs will the death of an innocent Creature. By <hi>death</hi> or <hi>deſtruction</hi> in this diſcourſe, the onely ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul and Body is not intended, which is a debt of nature, and which God, as Lord of Life and Death, may juſtly do, and make it not a puniſhment, but a bleſſing to the party; but we underſtand the ſubjecting of the Creature to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169972:73"/> eternall torments. Laſtly, he tells of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which redounds to others from Exemplary Juſtice, which is moſt true, but not according to his own grounds, for neither is it Juſtice to puniſh a man for doing that which it was impoſſible alwayes for him not to do; Neither is it lawfull to puniſh an innocent perſon, that good may come of it; And if his opinion of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of all things were true, the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men could not be altered, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples or fear of puniſhment.</p>

                  <label>J. D.</label> BUt the Patrons of neceſſity being driven out of the plain field with reaſon, have certain retreats or diſtinctions, which they fly unto for refuge. Firſt, they diſtinguiſh between Stoicall neceſſity and Chriſtian neceſſity, between which they make a threefold difference.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, ſay they, the Stoicks did ſubject <hi>Jupiter</hi> to deſtiny, but we ſubject deſtiny to God; I anſwer, that the Stoicall and Chriſtian deſtiny are one, and the ſame, <hi>fatum quaſi effatum Jovis.</hi> Hear Seneca, <hi>Deſtiny is the neceſſity of all things, and actions, depending upon the diſpoſition of Jupiter, &amp;c.</hi> I add, that the Stoicks left a greater liberty to <hi>Jupiter</hi> over deſtiny, than theſe Stoicall Chriſtians do to God over his decrees, either for the beginnings of things as <hi>Euripides,</hi> or for the progreſs of of them as <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> or at leaſt of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place, as all of them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, So <hi>Virgil, Sed trahere &amp; moras ducere, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Oſyris</hi> in <hi>Apuleius,</hi> promiſeth him to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169972:74"/> prolong his life <hi>Ultra fato conſtituta tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> beyond the times ſet down by the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p n="2">Next, they ſay, that the Stoicks did hold an eternall flux and neceſſary connexion of cauſes, but they believe that God doth act, <hi>praeter &amp; contra naturam,</hi> beſides and againſt nature. I anſwer, that it is not much materiall, whether they attribute neceſſity to God, or to the Starrs, or to a connexion of cauſes, ſo as they eſtabliſh neceſſity. The former reaſons do not onely condemn the ground or foundation of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but much more neceſſity it ſelf upon what ground ſoever. Either they muſt run into this abſurdity, that the effect is determined, the cauſe remaining undetermined, or els hold ſuch a neceſſary connexion of cauſes, as the Stoicks did.</p>
               <p n="3">Laſtly, they ſay, the Stoicks did take away liberty and contingence, but they admit it; I anſwer, what liberty or contingence was it they admit, but a titular liberty, and an empty ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of contingence? who do profeſs ſtifly, that all actions and events which either are or ſhall be, cannot but be, nor can be otherwiſe, after any other manner, in any other Place, Time, Number, Order, Meaſure, nor to any other end than they are, and that in reſpect of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining them to one; what a poor ridiculous liberty, or contingence is this?</p>
               <p>Secondly, they diſtinguiſh between the firſt cauſe, and the ſecond cauſes; they ſay, that in reſpect of the ſecond cauſes many things are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169972:74"/> free, but in reſpect of the firſt cauſe, all things are neceſſary. This anſwer may be taken away two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, ſo contraries ſhall be true together; The ſame thing at the ſame time ſhall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to one, and not determined to one; the ſame thing at the ſame time muſt neceſſarily be, and yet may not be. Perhaps they will ſay, not in the ſame reſpect. But that which ſtrikes at the root of this queſtion is this, If all the cauſes were onely collaterall, this exception might have ſome colour, but where all the cauſes being joined together, and ſubordinate one to another, do make but one totall cauſe, if any one cauſe (much more the firſt) in the whole ſeries, or ſubordination of cauſes be neceſſary, it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the reſt, and without doubt, makes the effect neceſſary; Neceſſity or Liberty is not to be eſteemed from one cauſe, but from all the cauſes joyned together. If one link in a chain be faſt, it faſtens all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, I would have them tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſecond cauſes be predetermined by the firſt cauſe or not; If it be determined, then the effect is neceſſary, even in reſpect of the ſecond cauſes; If the ſecond cauſe be not determined, how is the effect determined, the ſecond cauſe remaining undetermined? Nothing can give that to another which it hath not it ſelf. But ſay they, nevertheleſs the power or faculty remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth free. True, but not in order to the act, if it be once determined. It is free, <hi>in ſenſu di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> but not <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> when a man
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169972:75"/> holds a bird faſt in his hand, is ſhe therefore free to flie where ſhe will, becauſe ſhe hath wings? Or a man impriſoned or fettered, is he therefore free to walk where he will, becauſe he hath feet and a low motive faculty? Judge without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, what a miſerable ſubterfuge is this, which many men confide ſo much in.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>T. H.</label>Certain diſtinctions which he ſuppoſing may be brought to his arguments are by him remooved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HE ſaith, a man may perhaps anſwer, that the neceſſity of things held by him, is not a Stoicall neceſſity, but a Chriſtian neceſſity, &amp;c. but this diſtinction I have not uſed, nor indeed have ever heard before. Nor do I think any man could make Stoical and Chriſtian two kinds of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, though they may be two kinds of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Nor have I drawn my anſwer to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the authority of any Sect, but from the nature of the things themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But here I muſt take notice of certain words of his in this place, as making againſt his own Tenet, where all the cauſes, ſaith he, being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, and ſubordinate one to another, do make but one totall cauſe; If any one cauſe, much more the firſt, in the whole ſeries of ſubordination of cauſes be neceſſary, it determines the rest, and without doubt maketh the effect neceſſary. For, that which I call the neceſſary cauſe of any effect,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169972:75"/> is the joyning together of all cauſes ſubordinate to the firſt into one totall cauſe. If any one of thoſe, ſaith he, eſpecially the firſt, produce its effect ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, then all the reſt are determined, and the effect alſo neceſſary. Now, it is manifeſt, that the firſt cauſe is a neceſſary cauſe of all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that are next, and immediat to it, and therefore by his own reaſon, all effects are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Nor is that diſtinction of neceſſary, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the firſt cauſe, and neceſſary in reſpect of ſecond cauſes mine; It does (as he well noteth) imply a contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> BEcauſe <hi>T. H.</hi> diſavowes theſe two diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I have joyned them together in one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph. He likes not the diſtinction of neceſſity or deſtiny, into Stoicall and Chriſtian, no more do I. We agree in the concluſion, but our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are diverſe. My reaſon is, becauſe I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no ſuch neceſſity, either as the one or as the other, and becauſe I conceive, that thoſe Chriſtian writers, who do juſtly deteſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deſtiny of the Stoicks, as fearing to fall into thoſe groſs abſurdities and pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which flow from thence, do yet privily (though perhaps unwittingly) under another form of expreſſion, introduce it again at the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore after they had openly caſt it out at the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore: But <hi>T. H.</hi> ruſheth boldly without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (which he accounts but Jargon) and without foreſight upon the groſſeſt deſtiny of all others, that is, that of the Stoicks. He confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that <hi>they may be two kinds of doctrine,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:169972:76"/> May be? Nay, they are without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And he himſelf is the firſt who beares the name of a Chriſtian that I have read, that hath raiſed this ſleeping Ghoſt out of its grave, and ſet it out in its true colours. But yet he likes not the names of Stoicall and Chriſtian deſtiny, I do not blame him, though he would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be accounted a Stoick. To admit the thing, and quarrell about the name, is to make our ſelves ridiculous. Why might not I firſt call that kind of deſtiny, which is maintained by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Chriſtian deſtiny? and that other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Stoicks, Stoicall deſtiny? But I am not the inventer of the tearme. If he had been as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in reading other mens opinions, as he is confident in ſetting down his own, he might have found not only the thing, but the name it ſelf often uſed. But if the name of <hi>fatum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianum,</hi> do offend him, Let him call it with Lipſius, <hi>fatum verum,</hi> who divides deſtiny into four kinds; 1. Mathematicall or Aſtrologicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, 2. Naturall deſtiny, 3. Stoicall or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſtiny; and 4. true deſtiny, which he calls ordinarily <hi>noſtrum,</hi> our deſtiny; that is, of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and <hi>fatum pium,</hi> that is godly deſtiny, and defines it juſt as <hi>T. H.</hi> doth his deſtiny, to be a ſeries or order of cauſes depending upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Counſail, <hi>de conſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.18. &amp; 19. Though he be more cautelous than <hi>T. H.</hi> to decline thoſe rocks which ſome others have made ſhipwrack upon. Yet the Divines thought he came too neer them, as appeares by his Epiſtle to the Reader, in a later Edition. And by that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169972:76"/> note in the margent of his twentieth Chapter, <hi>Whatſoever I diſpute here, I ſubmit to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wiſe, and being admoniſhed, I will convert it. One may convince me of error, but not of obſtinacy.</hi> So fearfull was he to overſhoot himſelf, and yet he maintained both true liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and true contingency. <hi>T. H.</hi> ſaith, <hi>he hath not ſucked his anſwer from any Sect;</hi> And I ſay ſo much the worſe; It is better to be the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of an old Sect, than the ringleader of a new.</p>
               <p>Concerning the other deſtinction of liberty, in reſpect of the firſt cauſe, and liberty in reſpect of the ſecond cauſes, though he will not ſee that which it concerned him to anſwer, like thoſe old <hi>Damiae,</hi> which could put out their eyes when they liſt; As namely, that the faculty of willing, when it is determined in order to the act (which is all the freedom that he acknowledgeth) is but like the freedom of a bird, when ſhe is firſt in a mans hand, &amp;c. Yet he hath eſpied ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing wherein I contradict my ſelf, becauſe I affirm, that if any one cauſe in the whole ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of cauſes, much more the firſt cauſe, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it determineth the reſt. But, ſaith he, it is manifeſt, that the firſt cauſe is a neceſſary cauſe of all the effects that are next. I am glad, yet it is not I who contradict my ſelf, but it is one of his <hi>manifeſt truths</hi> which I contradict. That <hi>the firſt cauſe is a neceſſary cauſe of all effects,</hi> which I ſay, is a manifeſt falſhood. Thoſe things which God wills without himſelf, he wills freely not neceſſarily. Whatſoever cauſe acts or works
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169972:77"/> neceſſarily, doth act or work all that it can do, or all that is in its power; But it is evident, that God doth not all things without himſelf, which he can do, or which he hath power to do. He could have raiſed up children unto <hi>Abraham</hi> of the very ſtones, which were upon the banks of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Luk.</hi> 3.8. but he did not. He could have ſent twelve Legions of Angells to the ſuccour of Chriſt, but he did not. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.53. God can make <hi>T. H.</hi> live the years of <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> but it is not neceſſary that he ſhall do ſo, nor probable that he will do ſo. The productive power of God is infinite, but the whole created world is finite. And therefore God might ſtill produce more, if it pleaſed him. But this it is, when men go on in a confuſed way, and will admit no diſtinctions. If <hi>T. H.</hi> had conſidered the difference between a neceſſary being, and a neceſſary cauſe, or between thoſe actions of God, which are imminent within himſelf, and the tranſient works of God, which are extrinſecall without himſelf, he would never have propoſed ſuch an evident error, for a manifeſt truth. <hi>Qui pauca conſiderat, facile pronuntiat.</hi>

The Will, ſay they, is free from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, but not free from neceſſitation. And this they fortifie with two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it is granted by all Divines, that hypotheticall neceſſity, or neceſſity upon a ſuppoſition, may conſiſt with liberty; Secondly, becauſe God and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169972:77"/> the good Angells do good neceſſarily, and yet are more free than we. To the firſt reaſon I confeſs, that neceſſity upon a ſuppoſition may ſometimes conſiſt with true liberty, as when it ſignifies onely an infallible certitude of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in that which it knowes to be, or that it ſhall be; But if the ſuppoſition be not in the Agents power; nor depend upon any thing that is in his power; If there be an exteriour antecedent cauſe which doth neceſſitate the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to call this free, is to be mad with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond reaſon, I confeſs that God and the good Angells are more free than we are, that is, intenſively in the degree of freedom, but not extenſively in the latitude of the object, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a liberty of exerciſe, but not of ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A liberty of exerciſe, that is, to doe or not to do, may conſiſt well with a neceſſity of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, or a determination to the doing of good. But a liberty of exerciſe, and a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of exerciſe; A liberty of ſpecification; and a neceſſity of ſpecification, are not compatible, nor can conſiſt together. He that is antecedently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to do evill, is not free to do good. So this inſtance is nothing at all to the purpoſe.</p>

                  <hi>BUt the diſtinction of free, into free from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and free from neceſſitation, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for to be free from compulſion, is to do a thing ſo, as terrour be not the cauſe of his will to do it, for a man is then onely ſaid to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when fear makes him willing to it, as when a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169972:78"/> man willingly throwes his goods into the Sea to ſave himſelf, or ſubmitts to his enemy for fear of being killed. Thus all men that do any thing from love, or revenge, or luſt are free from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and yet their actions may be as neceſſary as thoſe which are done upon compulſion, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times other paſſions work as forcibly as fear; But free from neceſſitation I ſay nothing can be; And 'tis that which he undertook to diſproove. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, he ſayes, uſeth to be fortified by two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but they are not mine. The firſt, he ſayes is, That it is granted by all Divines, that an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheticall neceſſity, or neceſſity upon ſuppoſition, may ſtand with liberty. That you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, I will give you an example of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall neceſſity. If I ſhall live, I ſhall eat, this is an hypotheticall neceſſity. Indeed it is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary propoſition, that is to ſay, it is neceſſary that that propoſition ſhould be true, whenſoever utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but tis not the neceſſity of the thing, nor is it therefore neceſſary, that the man ſhall live, or that the man ſhall eat. I do not uſe to fortifie my diſtinctions with ſuch reaſons. Let him confute them as he will, it contents me. But I would have your Lordſhip take notice hereby, how an eaſy and plain thing, but withall falſe, may be with the grave uſage of ſuch tearmes, as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall neceſſity, and neceſſity upon ſuppoſition and ſuch like tearmes of Schoolemen, obſcur'd and made to ſeem profound learning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond reaſon that may confirm the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of free from compulſion, and free from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitation, he ſayes is, that God, and good Angells
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169972:78"/> do good neceſſarily, and yet are more free than we. The reaſon, though I had no need of, yet I think it ſo far forth good, as it is true, that God and good Angells do good neceſſarily, and yet are free; but becauſe I find not in the Articles of our faith, nor in the Decrees of our Church ſet down, in what manner I am to conceive God, and good Angells to work, by neceſſity, or in what ſenſe they work freely, I ſuſpend my ſentence in that point, and am content, that there may be a freedom from compulſion, and yet no freedom from neceſſitation, as hath been prooved in that, that a man may be neceſſitated to ſome actions without threats and without fear of danger; But how he can avoid the conſiſting together of freedom and neceſſity, ſuppoſing God and good Angells are freer than men, and yet do good neceſſarily, that we muſt now examin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I confeſs (ſaith he) that God and good Angells are more free than we, that is, intenſively in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of freedom, not extenſively in the latitude of the object, according to a liberty of exerciſe, not of ſpecification. Again, we have here two diſtinctions, that are no diſtinctions, but made to ſeem ſo by tearmes invented, by I know not whom, to cover ignorance, and blind the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Reader. For it cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there is any liberty greater than for a man to do what he will, and to forbear what he will. One heat may be more intenſive than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not one liberty than another. He that can do what he will, hath all liberty poſſibly, and he that cannot, has none at all. Alſo liberty (as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169972:79"/> he ſayes, the Schooles call it) of exerciſe, which is as I have ſaid before, a liberty to do, or not to do, cannot be without a liberty (which they call of ſpecification) that is to ſay, a liberty to do or not to do, this or that in particular; for how can a man conceive, that he has liberty to do any thing, that hath not liberty to do this or that, or ſomewhat in particular. If a man be forbidden in Lent to eat this and that, and every other particular kind of fleſh, how can he be underſtood to have a liberty to eat fleſh, more than he that hath no licenſe at all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You may by this again ſee the vanity of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions uſed in the Schooles; And I do not doubt but that the impoſing of them by authority of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours in the Church, hath been a great cauſe that men have laboured, though by ſedition, and evill courſes to ſhake them off; for nothing is more apt to beget hatred, than the tyranniſing over mans reaſon and underſtanding, eſpecially when it is done, not by the Scripture, but by pretenſe of learning, and more judgment than that of other men.</hi>

                  <label>J. D.</label> HE who will ſpeak with ſome of our great undertakers, about the grounds of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, had need either to ſpeak by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, or to learn a new Language, (I dare not call it Jargon or Canting) lately deviſed, not to ſet forth the truth, but to conceal falſhood. He muſt learn a new Liberty, a new Neceſſity, a new Contingency, a new Sufficiency, a new
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169972:79"/> Spontaneity, a new kind of Deliberation, a new kind of Election, a new Eternity, a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and in concluſion, a new Nothing. This propoſition, <hi>the will is free,</hi> may be underſtood in two ſenſes, Either that the will is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, or that the will is not alwayes neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, for if it be ordinarily, or at any time free from neceſſitation, my aſſertion is true, that there is freedom from neceſſity. The former ſenſe, that the will is not compelled, is acknowledged by all the world as a truth undeniable, <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas non cogitur.</hi> For, if the will may be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then it may both will and not will the ſame thing at the ſame time, under the ſame notion, but this implies a contradiction. Yet this Author (like the good woman whom her husband ſought up the ſtream when ſhe was drowned, upon pretenſe that when ſhe was living, ſhe uſed to go contrary courſes to all other people,) he holds, that true compulſion and fear, may make a man will, that which he doth not will, that is, in his ſenſe may compell the will. As when a man willingly throwes his goods into the Sea to ſave himſelf, or ſubmits to his enemy for fear of being killed, I anſwer, that <hi>T. H.</hi> miſtakes ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wayes in this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, he erreth in this, to think, that actions proceeding from fear, are properly compulſory actions, which in truth are not only voluntary, but free actions; neither compelled, nor ſo much as Phyſically neceſſitated. Another man, at the ſame time, in the ſame Ship, in the ſame ſtorm, may chooſe, and the ſame individuall man other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169972:80"/> adviſed, might chooſe, not to throw his goods overboard. It is the man himſelf, who chooſeth freely this means to preſerve his life. It is true, that if he were not in ſuch a condition, or if he were freed from the grounds of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fears, he would not chooſe neither the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of his goods into the Sea, nor the ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his enemy. But conſidering the preſent exigence of his affaires, reaſon dictates to him, that of two inconveniences, the leſs is to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, as a comparative good. Neither doth he will this courſe, as the end or direct object of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but as the means to attaine his end. And what Fear doth in theſe caſes, Love, Hope, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, &amp;c. may do in other caſes, that is, may occaſion a man to elect thoſe means to obtain his willed end, which otherwiſe he would not elect. As <hi>Jacob</hi> to ſerve ſeven years more, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not to enjoy his beloved <hi>Rachel.</hi> The Merchant to hazard himſelf upon the rough Seas, in hope of profit. Paſſions may be ſo violent, that they may neceſſitate the will, that is, when they prevent deliberations, but this is rarely, and then the will is not free. But they never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly compell it. That which is compelled, is againſt the will, and that which is againſt the will, is not willed.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, <hi>T. H.</hi> erres in this alſo, where he ſaith, that <hi>a man is then onely ſaid to be compelled when fear makes him willing to an action.</hi> As if force were not more prevalent with a man then fear; we muſt know therefore, that this word <hi>compelled</hi> is taken two wayes, ſometimes impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169972:80"/> that is, when a man is mooved or occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by threats or fear, or any paſſion, to do that which he would not have done, if that threats, or that paſſion had not been; Sometimes it is taken properly, when we do any thing againſt our own inclination, mooved by an externall cauſe, the will not conſenting, nor concurring, but reſiſting as much as it can. As in a Rape, or when a Chriſtian is drawn or carried by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Idolls Temple. Or as in the caſe of St. Peter, John 21.18. <hi>Another ſhall guide thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldſt not.</hi> This is that compulſion which is underſtood, when we ſay, the will may be letted, or changed, or neceſſitated, or that the imperate actions of the will (that is, the actions of the inferiour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are ordinarily moved by the will) may be compelled; but that the immanent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the will, that is, to will, to chooſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compelled, becauſe it is the nature of an action properly compelled to be done by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall cauſe, without the concurrence of the will.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, the queſtion is not, whether all the actions of a man be free, but whether they be ordinarily free. Suppoſe ſome paſſions are ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and violent, that they ſurpriſe a man, and betray the ſuccours of the ſoul, and prevent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, as we ſee in ſome <hi>motus primo primi;</hi> or antipathies, how ſome men will run upon the moſt dangerous objects, upon the firſt view of a loathed creature, without any power to contain themſelves. Such actions as theſe, as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169972:81"/> they are not ordinary, ſo they are not free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no deliberation nor election. But where deliberation and election are, as when a man throwes his goods over-board, to ſave the Ship, or ſubmitts to his enemy, to ſave his life; there is alwayes true liberty.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>T. H.</hi> ſlight the two reaſons which I produce in favour of his cauſe, yet they who urged them, deſerved not to be ſlighted, unleſs it were becauſe they were School-men. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſon is thus framed; A neceſſity of ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition may conſiſt with true liberty, but that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which flowes from the naturall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall determination of the will, is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſuppoſition; To this, my anſwer is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; That a neceſſity of ſuppoſition is of two kinds, ſometimes the thing ſuppoſed is in the power of the Agent to do, or not to do; As for a Romiſh Prieſt to vow continence, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that he be a Romiſh Prieſt, is neceſſary, but becauſe it was in his power to be a Prieſt, or not to be a Prieſt, therefore his vow is a free act. So ſuppoſing a man to have taken Phyſick, it is neceſſary that he keep at home, yet becauſe it was in his power to take a Medicine or not to take it, therefore his keeping at home is free. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſometimes the thing ſuppoſed is not in the power of the Agent to do, or not to do; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a man to be extrem ſick, it is neceſſary that he keep at home, or ſuppoſing that a man hath a naturall antipathy againſt a Cat, he runs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily away ſo ſoon as he ſees her. Becauſe this antipathy, and this ſickneſs are not in the power
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169972:81"/> of the party affected, therefore theſe acts are not free. <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed his Sons, <hi>Balaam</hi> bleſſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> theſe two acts being done, are both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary upon ſuppoſition; But is was in <hi>Jacobs</hi> power not to have bleſſed his Sons, So was it not in <hi>Balaams</hi> power, not to have bleſſed <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Numb.</hi> 22.38. <hi>Jacobs</hi> will was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by himſelf, <hi>Balaams</hi> will was Phyfically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God. Therefore <hi>Jacobs</hi> benediction proceeded from his own free election; And <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> from Gods determination. So was <hi>Caiphas</hi> his Propheſy, <hi>John</hi> 11.51. Therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>He ſpake not of himſelf.</hi> To this <hi>T. H.</hi> ſaith nothing, but only declareth by an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent inſtance, what <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> ſignifies. And then adviſeth your Lordſhip to take notice how Errours and Ignorance may be cloked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grave Scholaſtick tearmes. And I do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe intreat your Lordſhip to take notice, that the greateſt fraud and cheating, lurks commonly under the pretenſe of plain dealing; we ſee Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers commonly ſtrip up their ſleeves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe extraordinary fair dealing before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to play their tricks.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond argument drawn from the liberty of God, and the good Angells. As I cannot but approove his modeſty, in ſuſpending his judgment concerning the manner how God and the good Angells do work neceſſarily or freely, becauſe he finds it not ſet down in the Articles of our Faith, or the Decrees of our Church, eſpecially in this age, which is ſo full of Atheiſme, and of thoſe ſcoffers which St. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:169972:82"/> Propheſied of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. Who neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is God or Angells, or that they have a Soul, but only as ſalt, to keep their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from putrifaction; So I can by no means aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto him, in that which followes, that is to ſay, that he hath proved, that Liberty and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the ſame kind may conſiſt together, that is, a liberty of exerciſe with a neceſſity of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, or a liberty of ſpecification, with a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſpecification. Thoſe actions which he ſaith are neceſſitated by paſſion, are for the moſt part dictated by reaſon, either truly, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently right, and reſolved by the will it ſelf. But it troubles him that I ſay, that God and the good Angells are more free than men intenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the degree of freedom, but not extenſively in the latitude of the object, according to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of exerciſe, but not of ſpecification, which he ſaith, are no diſtinctions, but tearmes inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cover ignorance. Good words. Doth he onely ſee? Are all other men ſtark bling? By his favour, they are true and neceſſary diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; And if he alone do not conceive them, it is becauſe diſtinctions, as all other things, have their fates, according to the capacities or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of their Readers. But he urgeth two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>One heate, ſaith he, may be more intenſive than another, but not one liberty than another.</hi> Why not, I wonder? Nothing is more proper to a man than reaſon, yet a man is more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall than a child, and one man more rationall than another, that is, in reſpect of the uſe and exerciſe of reaſon. As there are degrees of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169972:82"/> ſo there are of liberty. The good Angells have cleerer underſtandings than we, and they are not hindred with paſſions as we, and by conſequence, they have more uſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty than we. His ſecond reaſon is, <hi>He that can do what he will, hath all liberty, and he that cannot do what he will, hath no liberty.</hi> If this be true, then there are no degrees of liberty indeed. But this which he calls liberty, is rather an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence than a liberty, to do whatſoever he will. A man is free to ſhoot, or not to ſhoot, although he cannot hit the white, when ſoever he would. We do good freely, but with more difficulty and reluctation than the good Spirits. The more rationall, and the leſs ſenſuall the will is, the greater is the degree of liberty. His other exception againſt liberty of exerciſe, and liberty of ſpecification, is a meer miſtake, which growes meerly from not rightly underſtanding what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſpecification, or contrariety is. A liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpecification, ſaith he, is a liberty to do, or not to do, or not to do this, or that, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Upon better advice he will find, that this which he calls a liberty of ſpecification, is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of contradiction, and not of ſpecification, nor of contrariety. To be free to do or not to do, this or that particular good, is a liberty of contradiction, ſo likewiſe to be free to do or not to do this, or that particular evill. But to be free to do both good and evill, is a liberty of contrariety, which extends to contrary objects, or to diverſe kinds of things. So his reaſon to proove, that a liberty of exerciſe cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169972:83"/> a liberty of ſpecification, falls flat to the ground. And he may lay aſide his Lenten licenſe for another occaſion. I am aſhamed to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things which are ſo evident, that no man can queſtion them who doth underſtand them.</p>
               <p>And here he falls into another invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſtinctions, and Scholaſticall expreſſions, and the <hi>Doctors of the Church, who by this means tyrannized over the underſtandings of other men.</hi> What a preſumption is this for one private man, who will not allow human liberty to others, to aſſume to himſelf ſuch a licenſe, to controll ſo Magiſtrally, and to cenſure of groſs ignorance and tyranniſing over mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea, as cauſes of the troubles and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults which are in the world, the Doctors of the Church in generall, who have flouriſhed in all ages and all places, only for a few neceſſary and innocent diſtinctions. Truly ſaid <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that a ſore eye is offended with the light of the Sun; what then muſt the Logicians lay aſide their firſt and ſecond Intentions? their Abſtracts and Conceits, their Subjects and Predicates, their Modes and Figures, their Method Synthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Analytick, their Fallacies of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diviſion, &amp;c? Muſt the morall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher quitt his means and extremes, his <hi>pricipia congenita ad acquiſita,</hi> his liberty of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and contrariety, his neceſſity abſolute and hypotheticall, &amp;c? Muſt the naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher give over his intentionall Species, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Agent and Patient, his receptive
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169972:83"/> and eductive power of the matter, his qualities, <hi>infinitae</hi> or <hi>influxae, ſymbolae</hi> or <hi>diſſymbolae,</hi> his temperament, <hi>ad pondus,</hi> and <hi>ad juſtitiam,</hi> his parts Homogeneous &amp; Heterogeneous, his Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies and Antipathies, his Antiperiſtaſis, &amp;c? Muſt the Aſtrologer and the Geographer leave their <hi>Apogaeum</hi> and <hi>Perigaeum,</hi> their Arctick and Antarctick Poles, their Aequator, Zodiack, Zenith, Meridian, Horiſon, Zones, &amp;c? Muſt the Mathematician, the Metaphyſician, and the Divine, relinquiſh all their tearmes of Art, and proper idiotiſmes, becauſe they do not relliſh with <hi>T. H.</hi> his palate? But he will ſay, they are obſcure expreſſions; What marvell is it, when the things themſelves are more obſcure; Let him put them into as plain Engliſh as he can, and they ſhall be never a whit the better underſtood by thoſe who want all grounds of learning. Nothing is clearer than Mathematicall demonſtration, yet let one who is altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in Mathematicks hear it, and he will hold it to be as <hi>T. H.</hi> tearmes theſe diſtinctions, plain Fuſtian or Jargon. Every Art or Profeſſion hath its proper myſteries and expreſſions, which are well known to the Sons of Art, not ſo to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Let him conſult with Military men, with Phyſitians, with Navigators, and he ſhall find this true by experience. Let him go on ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and the Mariners will not leave their Sterbord and Larbord, becauſe they pleaſe not him, or becauſe he accounts it Gibriſh. No, no, it is not the Schoole-Divines, but Innovators and ſeditious Oratours, who are the true cauſes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169972:84"/> cauſes of the preſent troubles of Europe. <hi>T. H.</hi> hath forgotten what he ſaid in his book, <hi>De Cive cap.</hi> 12. That it is a ſeditious opinion to teach, that the knowledge of good and evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to private perſons. And cap. 17. that in queſtions of Faith the Civill Magiſtrates ought to <hi>conſult with the Eccleſiaſticall Doctors, to whom Gods bleſſing is derived by impoſition of hands, ſo as not to be received in neceſſary truths, to whom our Saviour hath promiſed infallibility.</hi> Theſe are the very men whom he traduceth here. There he aſcribes infallibility to them, here he accuſeth them of groſs ſuperſtitious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. There he attributes too much to them, here he attributes too little. Both there and here he takes too much upon him. <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.32.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> NOw, to the diſtinction it ſelf I ſay firſt, that the proper act of liberty is election, and election is oppoſed, not only to coaction, but alſo to coarctation or determination to one. Neceſſitation or determination to one, may conſiſt with ſpontaneity, but not with election or liberty, as hath been ſhewed. The very Stoicks did acknowledge a ſpontaneity. So our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are not yet gone out of the confines of the Stoicks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to rip up the bottom of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This I take to be the clear reſolution of the Schooles; There is a double act of the will, the one more remote, called <hi>Imperatus,</hi> that is,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169972:84"/> in truth the act of ſome inferiour faculty, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the command of the will, as to open or ſhut ones eyes, without doubt theſe actions may be compelled. The other act is neerer, called <hi>actus elicitus,</hi> an act drawn out of the will, as to will, to chooſe, to elect, this may be ſtopped or hindered by the intervening impediment of the underſtanding, as a ſtone lying on a table is kept from its naturall motion, otherwiſe the will ſhould have a kind of Omnipotence; But the will cannot be compelled to an act repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to its inclination, as when a ſtone is thrown upwards into the air, for that is both to incline, and not to incline to the ſame object, at the ſame time, which implies a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore to ſay the will is neceſſitated, is to ſay, the will is compelled ſo far as the will is capable of compulſion. If a ſtrong man holding the hand of a weaker, ſhould therewith kill a third perſon, <hi>haec quidem vis eſt,</hi> this violence, the weaker did not willingly perpetrate the fact, becauſe he was compelled. But now ſuppoſe this ſtrong man had the will of the weaker in his power as well as the hand, and ſhould not onely incline, but determine it ſecretly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to commit this act, is not the caſe the ſame? whether one raviſh <hi>Lucretia</hi> by force, as <hi>Tarquine,</hi> or by amatory potions, and Magicall Incantations, not only allure her, but neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her to ſatisfy his luſt, and incline her effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and draw her inevitably, and irreſiſtibly to follow him ſpontaneouſly. <hi>Lucretia</hi> in both theſe conditions is to be pittied, but the latter
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169972:85"/> perſon is more guilty, and deſerves greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, who endevours alſo ſo much as in him lies, to make <hi>Lucretia</hi> irreſiſtibly partake of his crime. I dare not apply it, but thus only; Take heed how we defend thoſe ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible neceſſitations to evill, though ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and free from coaction.</p>
               <p>Theſe are their faſtneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>T. H.</label> 
                  <hi>IN the next place, he bringeth two arguments againſt diſtinguiſhing between being free from compulſion, and free from neceſſitation. The firſt is, that election is oppoſite, not onely to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action or compulſion, but alſo to neceſſitation or determination to one. This is it he was to proove from the beginning, and therefore bringeth no new argument to proove it. And to thoſe brought formerly, I have already anſwered; And in this place I deny again, that election is oppoſite to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for when a man is compelled (for example, to ſubject himſelf to an enemy or to dy) he hath ſtill election left in him, and a deliberation to bethink which of theſe two he can better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; And he that is led to priſon by force, hath election and may deliberate whether he will be hailed and trained on the ground, or make uſe of his feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewiſe when there is no compulſion, but the ſtrength of temptation to do an evill action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater than the motives to abſtain, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily determine him to the doing of it, yet he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berates whiles ſometimes the motives to do, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the motives to forbear, are working on him,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169972:85"/> and conſequently he electeth which he will. But commonly when we ſee and know the ſtrength that moves us, we acknowledge Neceſſity, but when we ſee not, or mark not the force that moves us, we then think there is none, and that it is not Cauſes but liberty, that produceth the action. Hence it is, that they think he does not choſe this, that of neceſſity choſeth it, but they might as well ſay, fire does not burn, becauſe it burnes of neceſſity. The ſecond argument is not ſo much an argument, as a diſtinction, to ſhew in what ſenſe it may be ſaid, that voluntary actions are neceſſitated, and in what ſenſe not. And therefore he alledgeth as from the authority of the Schooles, and that which rippeth up the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the queſtion, that there is a double act of the will; The one he ſayes, is <hi>actus Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> an act done at the command of the will, by ſome inferiour faculty of the ſoul, as to open or ſhut ones eyes, and this act may be compelled. The other he ſayes, is <hi>actus elicitus,</hi> an act allured, or an act drawn forth by allurement out of the will, as to will, to chooſe, to elect: This he ſayes cannot be compelled. Wherein letting paſs that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall ſpeech of attributing command and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the faculties of the Soul, as if they made a Common-wealth or Family among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and could ſpeak one to another, which is very improper in ſearching the truth of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. You may obſerve firſt, that to compell a voluntary act, is nothing els, but to will it, for it is all one to ſay, my will commands the ſhutting of mine eyes, or the doing of any other action, and to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169972:86"/> ſay, I have the will to ſhut mine eyes. So that <hi>actus imperatus</hi> here, might as eaſily have been ſaid in Engliſh, a voluntary action, but that they that invented the tearme, underſtood not any thing it ſignified. Secondly, you may obſerve, that <hi>actus elicitus,</hi> is exemplified by theſe words, to Will, to Elect, to Chooſe, which are all one, and ſo to will is here made an act of the will, and indeed, as the will is a faculty, or power in a mans ſoul, ſo to will is an act of it, according to that power. But as it is abſurdly ſaid, that to dance is an act allured or drawn by fair means out of the ability to dance; ſo it is alſo to ſay, that to will, is an act allured or drawn out of the power to will, which power is commonly called, the Will. Howſoever it be, the ſumme of his diſtinction is, that a voluntary act may be done on compulſion, that is to ſay, by foul means, but to will that, or any act, cannot be but by allurement or fair means. Now, ſeeing fair Means, Allurements, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, produce the action which they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, as neceſſarily as threatning and foul means, it followes, that to will, may be made as neceſſary as any thing that is done by compulſion. So that the diſtinction of <hi>actus imperatus,</hi> and <hi>actus elicitus,</hi> are but words, and of no effect againſt neceſſity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> IN the next place follow two reaſons of mine own againſt the ſame diſtinction, the one taken from the former grounds, that Election cannot conſiſt with determination to one. To this (he ſaith) he hath <hi>anſwered already.</hi> No,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169972:86"/> Truth is founded upon a Rock. He hath been ſo far from prevailing againſt it, that he hath not been able to ſhake it. Now again, he tells us, that <hi>Election is not oppoſite to either,</hi> (Neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Compulſion) He might even as well tell us, that a ſtone thrown upwards mooves natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; Or, that a woman can be raviſhed with her own will. Conſent takes away the Rape. This is the ſtrangeſt liberty that ever was heard of, that a man is compelled to do what he would not, and yet is free to do what he will. And this he tells us upon the old ſcore, that <hi>he, who ſubmits to his enemy for fear of death, chooſeth to ſubmit.</hi> But we have ſeen formerly, that this, which he calls compulſion, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion properly, nor that naturall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will, to one which is oppoſite to true Liberty. He who ſubmits to an enemy for ſaving his life, doth either onely counterfeit, and then there is no will to ſubmit, this diſguiſe is no more than a ſtepping aſide, to avoid a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent blow, Or els he doth ſincerely will a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and then the will is changed; There is a vaſt difference between compelling and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the will. Either God or man may change the will of man, either by varying the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, or by informing the party other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but compelled it cannot be, that is, it cannot both will this, and not will this, as it is inveſted with the ſame circumſtances, though, if the act were otherwiſe circumſtantiated, it might nill that freely, which now it wills freely. Wherefore the kind of actions are called mixt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169972:87"/> actions, that is partly voluntary, partly unvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary. That which is compelled is a mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition or diſtreſs, that is not voluntary nor choſen. That which is choſen, is the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of its diſtreſs, that is voluntary. So hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically ſuppoſing a man were not in that diſtreſs they are involuntary, but abſolutely without any ſuppoſition at all, taking the caſe as it is, they are voluntary. His other inſtance of <hi>a man forced to priſon, that he may chooſe whether he will be haled thither upon the ground, or walk upon his feet</hi> is not true. By his leave, that is not as he pleaſeth, but as it pleaſeth them who have him in their power. If they will drag him, he is not free to walk; And if they give him leave to walk, he is not forced to be dragged. Having laid this foundation, he begins to build upon it, that <hi>other paſſions do neceſſitate as much as fear;</hi> But he erres doubly; firſt, in his foundation, fear doth not determine the rationall will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and neceſſarily; The laſt and greateſt of the five terrible things is death, yet the fear of death cannot neceſſitate a reſolved mind to do a diſhoneſt action, which is worſe than death. The fear of the fiery furnace could not compell the three Children to worſhip an Idoll, nor the fear of the Lions neceſſitate <hi>Daniel,</hi> to omit his duty to God, It is our frailty, that we are more afraid of empty ſhadows than of ſubſtantiall dangers, becauſe they are neerer our ſenſes, as little Children fear a Mouſe or a Viſard, more than fire or weather. But as a fitte of the ſtone takes awuy the ſenſe of the gout for the preſent,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169972:87"/> ſo the greater paſſion doth extinguiſh the leſs. The fear of Gods wrath, and eternall torments doth expell corporall fear, <hi>fear not them who kill the body, but fear him who is able to caſt both body and ſoul into hell.</hi> Luk. 7.4. <hi>Da veniam Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, tu carcerem, ille gehennam minatur,</hi> Excuſe me, O Emperor, thou threatens men with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he threatens me with hell. Secondly, he erres in his ſuperſtruction alſo. There is a great difference, as to this caſe of juſtifying, or not juſtifying an action between force and fear, and other paſſions; Force doth not only leſſen the ſin, but takes it quite away, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.26. He who forced a betrothed Damſell was to die; <hi>but unto the Damſell</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there is in her no fault worthy of death. Tamars</hi> beauty, or <hi>Ammons</hi> love did not render him innocent, but <hi>Ammons</hi> force rendred <hi>Tamar</hi> innocent. But fear is not ſo prevalent as force, Indeed if fear be great, and juſtly grounded, ſuch as may fall upon a conſtant man, though it do not diſpenſe with the tranſgreſſion of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Precepts of God or Nature, becauſe they bind to all times, yet it diminiſheth the offence, even againſt them, and pleades for pardon. But it diſpenſeth in many caſes with the tranſgreſſion of the poſitive Law, either Divine or humane; Becauſe it is not probable, that God or the Law, would oblige man to the obſervation of all poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts, with ſo great dammage as the loſs of his life. The omiſſion of Circumciſion was no ſin, whileſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were travelling through the wilderneſs. By <hi>T. H.</hi> his permiſſion. I will
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169972:88"/> propoſe a caſe to him. A Gentleman ſends his ſervant with mony to buy his dinner, ſome Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians meet him by the way, and take it from him by force, The ſervant cryed for help, and did what he could to defend himſelf, but all would not ſerve. The ſervant is innocent, if he was to be tried before a Court of Areopagites. Or ſuppoſe the Ruffians did not take it from him by force, but drew their ſwords and threatned to kill him, except he delivered it himſelf; no wiſe man will conceive, that it was either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters intention, or the ſervants duty, to hazard his life, or his limbes, for ſaving of ſuch a trifling ſum. But on the other ſide ſuppoſe this ſervant, paſſing by ſome Cabaret, or Tennis-court, where his Camerads were drinking or playing, ſhould ſtay with them, and drink or play away his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and afterwards plead as <hi>T. H.</hi> doth here, that he was overcome by the meer ſtrength of temptation, I trow, neither <hi>T. H.</hi> nor any man els would admit of this excuſe, but puniſh him for it, becauſe, neither was he neceſſitated by the temptation, and what ſtrength it had, was by his own fault, in reſpect of that vitious habit which he had contracted of drinking or gaming, Jam. 1, 14. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt and entiſed.</hi> Diſordered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of anger, hatred, luſt, if they be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent (as the caſe is here put by <hi>T. H.</hi>) and flow from deliberation and election, they do not only not diminiſh the fault, but they aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it, and render it much greater.</p>
               <p>He talks much of <hi>the motives to do, and the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169972:88"/> motives to forbear,</hi> how they work upon and determine a man, as if a reaſonable man were no more than a Tennis-ball, to be toſſed to and fro by the Racketts of the ſecond cauſes; As if the will had no power to moove it ſelf, but were meerly paſſive, like an artificiall Popingay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved hither and thither by the bolts of the Archers, who ſhoot on this ſide and on that. What are motives but reaſons or diſcourſes fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the underſtanding, and freely mooved by the will? What, are the will and the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but faculties of the ſame ſoul? and what is liberty but a power reſulting from them both? To ſay that the will is determined by theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, is as much as to ſay, that the Agent is determined by himſelf; If there be no neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the judgment of right reaſon doth dictate to the will, then there is no antecedent, no extrinſecall neceſſitation at all. All the world knowes, that when the Agent is determined by himſelf, then the effect is determined likewiſe in its cauſe. But if he determined himſelf freely, then the effect is free. Motives determine not naturally but morally, which kind of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may conſiſt with true liberty. But if <hi>T. H.</hi> his opinion were true, that the will were naturally determined by the Phyſicall and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall influence of extrinſecall cauſes, not onely motives were vain, but reaſon it ſelf, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were vain. No, ſaith he, they are not vain, becauſe they are the means. Yes, if the means be ſuperfluous they are vain, what needed ſuch a circuit of deliberation to adviſe what is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169972:89"/> fit to be done, when it is already determined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally, what muſt be done.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, that <hi>the ignorance of the true cauſes, and their power is the reaſon, why we aſcribe the effect to liberty, but when we ſeriouſly conſider the cauſes of things, we acknowledge a neceſſity.</hi> No ſuch thing, but juſt the contrary. The more we conſider, and the cleerer we underſtand, the greater is the liberty, and the more the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own liberty. The leſs we conſider, and the more incapable that the underſtanding is, the leſſer is the liberty, and the knowledge of it. And where there is no conſideration, nor uſe of reaſon, there is no liberty at all, there is neither morall good nor evill. Some men, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that their exteriour ſenſes are not totally bound, have a trick to walk in their ſleep. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch an one in that caſe ſhould caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down a pair of ſtaires, or from a bridge, and break his neck, or drown himſelf, it were a mad Jury that would find this man acceſſary to his own death. Why? becauſe it was not freely done, he had not then the uſe of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he tells us, that <hi>the will doth chooſe of neceſſity, as well as the fire burnes of neceſſity.</hi> If he intend no more but this, that election is the proper and naturall act of the will, as burning is of the fire, or that the elective power is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily in a man as viſibility; he ſpeaks truly, but moſt impertinently; For, the queſtion is not now of the elective power, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> whether it be an eſſentiall faculty of the ſoul, but whether the act of electing this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169972:89"/> object be free, &amp; undetermined by any antecedent and extrinſecall cauſes. But if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it in this other ſenſe, that as the fire hath no power to ſuſpend its burning, nor to diſtinguiſh between thoſe combuſtible matters which are put unto it, but burnes that which is put unto it neceſſarily, if it be combuſtible: So the will hath no power to refuſe that which it wills, nor to ſuſpend its own appetite. He erres groſſely. The will hath power, either to will or nill, or to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, that is neither to will nor nill the ſame object; Yet even the burning of the fire, if it be conſidered as it is inveſted with all particular circumſtances, is not otherwiſe ſo neceſſary an action as <hi>T. H.</hi> imagineth. Two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make an effect neceſſary. Firſt, that it be produced by a neceſſary cauſe, ſuch as fire is; Secondly, that it be neceſſarily produced, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras</hi> an Atheiſt, began his Book thus. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the gods, I have nothing to ſay, whether they be, or they be not,</hi> for which his Book was condemned by the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be burned. The fire was a neceſſary agent, but the ſentence or the application of the fire to the Book, was a free act, and therefore the burning of his Book was free. Much more the rationall will is free, which is both a voluntary agent, and acts volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily.</p>
               <p>My ſecond reaſon againſt this diſtinction of Liberty from Compulſion, but not from neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is new, and demonſtrates cleerly, that to neceſſitate the will, by a Phyſicall neceſſity, is to compell the will ſo far as the will is capable of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169972:90"/> Compulſion, and that he, who doth neceſſitate the will to evill, after that manner is the true cauſe of evill, and ought rather to be blamed than the will it ſelf. But <hi>T. H.</hi> for all he ſaith he is not ſurpriſed, can be contented upon better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to ſteal by all this in ſilence; And to hide this tergiverſation from the eyes of the Reader, he makes an empty ſhew of braving againſt that famous and moſt neceſſary diſtinction between the <hi>elicite</hi> and <hi>imperate</hi> acts of the will; firſt, becauſe the termes are <hi>improper;</hi> ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>obſcure.</hi> What Triviall and Grammaticall objections are theſe, to be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the univerſall currant of Divines and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. <hi>Verborum ut nummorum,</hi> It is in words, as it is in mony. Uſe makes them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and currant, A <hi>Tyrant</hi> at firſt, ſignified a lawfull and juſt Prince; Now, uſe hath quite changed the ſenſe of it, to denote either an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or an Oppreſſor. The word <hi>praemunire</hi> is now grown a good word in our Engliſh Lawes by uſe and tract of time; And yet at firſt it was meerly miſtaken for a <hi>praemonere.</hi> The names of Sunday, Munday. Tueſday, were derived at firſt from thoſe Heatheniſh Deities, the Sun, the Moon, and the warlike God of the Germans. Now we uſe them for diſtinction ſake onely, without any relation to their firſt originall. He is too froward that will refuſe a piece of coin that is currant throughout the world, becauſe it is not ſtamped after his own fancy. So is he that rejects a good word, becauſe he underſtands not the derivation of it. We ſee forreine words are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169972:90"/> daily naturalized, and made free Denizons in every Country. But why are the tearmes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper? Becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>It attributes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſubjection to the faculties of the ſoul, as if they made a Common-wealth or family among themſelves, and could ſpeak one to another,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>they who invented this tearm of</hi> Actus Imperatus, <hi>underſtood not any thing what it ſignified.</hi> No, why not? It ſeemeth to me they underſtood it better than thoſe who except againſt it. They knew, there are <hi>mentall tearmes,</hi> which are onely conceived in the mind, as well as <hi>vocall tearmes,</hi> which are expreſſed with the tongue, They knew that howſoever a Superiour do intimate a direction to his inferiour, it is ſtill a command. <hi>Tarquin</hi> commanded his ſon, by onely ſtriking off the topps of the Poppies, and was by him both underſtood and obeyed. Though there be no formall <hi>Common-wealth</hi> or <hi>family</hi> either in the body, or in the ſoul of man, yet there is a ſubordination in the body, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour members to the head, there is a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the ſoul of the inferiour faculties to the rationall will. Far be it from a reaſonable man, ſo far to diſhonour his own nature, as to equall fancy with underſtanding, or the ſenſitive appetite with the reaſonable will. A power of command there is without all queſtion, though there be ſome doubt in what faculty this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand doth principally reſide, whether in the will or in the underſtanding. The true reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that the directive command for counſel is in the underſtanding; And the applicative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169972:91"/> or empire, for putting in execution of what is directed, is in the will. The ſame anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſerves for his ſecond impropriety, about the word Elicite. For, ſaith he, <hi>as it is abſurdly ſaid, that to dance, is an act allured, or drawn by fair means out of the ability to dance; So it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly ſaid, that to will or chooſe is an act drawn out of the power to will.</hi> His objection is yet more improper than their expreſſion. The art of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing rather reſembles the underſtanding, than the will. That drawing, which the Schools in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is cleer of another nature, from that which he conceives; By <hi>elicitation,</hi> he underſtands, a perſwading or enticing with flattering words, or ſweet alluring inſinuations, to chooſe, this or that. But that <hi>elicitation,</hi> which the Schools in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is a deducing of the power of the will into act, that <hi>drawing,</hi> which they mention, is meerly from the appetibility of the object, or of the end, as a man <hi>drawes</hi> a Child after him with the ſight of a fair Apple, or a Shepheard <hi>drawes</hi> his ſheep after him with the ſight of a green bough: So the end <hi>drawes</hi> the will to it, by a Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall motion. What he underſtands here by an ability to dance, is more than I know, or any man els, untill he expreſs himſelf in more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tearmes, whether he underſtand the <hi>locomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> faculty alone, or the art, or acquired habit of dancing alone, or both of theſe jointly. It may be ſaid aptly without any abſurdity, that the act of dancing is drawn out <hi>(elicitur)</hi> of the <hi>locomotive</hi> faculty helped by the acquired habit. He who is ſo ſcrupulous about the received
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169972:91"/> phraſes of the Schools ſhould not have let ſo many improper expreſſions have dropped from his pen; as in this very paſſage he confounds the <hi>compelling of a voluntary action,</hi> with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of a voluntary action, and <hi>willing</hi> with <hi>electing,</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>are all one.</hi> Yet to will properly reſpects the end, to elect the means.</p>
               <p>His other objection againſt this diſtinction of the acts of the will into Elicite and Imperate, is obſcurity. <hi>Might it not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have been as eaſily ſaid in Engliſh, a voluntary action.</hi> Yes, it might have been ſaid as eaſily, but not as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor properly. Whatſoever hath its originall from the will, whether immediatly or mediatly, whether it be a proper act of the will it ſelf, as to elect, or an act of the underſtanding, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, or an act of the inferiour faculties, or of the members, is a voluntary action, but neither the act of reaſon nor of the ſenſes, nor of the ſenſitive appetite, nor of the members are the poper acts of the will, nor drawn immediatly out of the will it ſelf, but the members and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are applyed to their proper and reſpective acts by the power of the will.</p>
               <p>And ſo he comes to caſt up the totall ſum of my ſecond reaſon, with the ſame faith, that the unjuſt Steward did make his accounts, Luk. 16. <hi>The ſum of</hi> J. D.'s <hi>diſtinction is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a voluntary act may be done on compulſion</hi> (juſt contrary to what I have maintained) <hi>that is to ſay, by foul means. But to will that, or any act cannot be but by allurement or fair means.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169972:92"/> the diſtinction is mine, becauſe I uſe it, as the Sun is mine, or the Air is mine, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to me, with all who treat of this ſubject. But his miſtakes are ſo thick, both in relating my mind, and his own, that the Reader may conclude, he is wandered out of his known way. I will do my duty to ſhew him the right way. Firſt, no acts which are properly ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, are voluntary. Secondly, acts of terrour (which he calls foul means) which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a large improper ſenſe called compulſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actions, may be, and for the moſt part are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true liberty. Thirdly, actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from blandiſhments or ſweet perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which he calls fair means) if they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberated as in children, who want the uſe of reaſon, are not preſently free actions. Laſtly, the ſtrength of conſequent, and deliberated deſires doth neither diminiſh guilt, nor excuſe from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as juſt fears of extreme and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers threatned by extrinſecall agents of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do, becauſe the ſtrength of the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from our own fault, and was freely ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the cauſes of it; But neither deſires nor fears, which are conſequent and deliberated, do abſolutely neceſſitate the will.</p>

                  <label>J. D.</label> THirdly, the morall Philoſopher tells us how we are haled hither and thither with outward objects. To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the power, which outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have over us, is for the moſt part by our own default, becauſe of thoſe vitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits which we have contracted. Therefore, though the actions ſeem to have a kind of violence in them, yet they were free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in their firſt originalls. As a paralitick man, to uſe <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> compariſon, ſhedding the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor deſerves to be puniſhed, for though his act be unwilling, yet his intemperance was willing, whereby he contracted this infirmity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that concupiſcence, and cuſtome, and bad company, and outward objects do indeed make a proclivity, but not a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. By Prayers, Tears, Meditations, Vowes, Watchings, Faſtings, Humi-cubations a man may get a contrary habit, and gain the victory, not onely over outward objects, but alſo over his own corruptions, and become the King of the little world of himſelf.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Si metuis, ſi prava cupis, ſi duceris irâ,</l>
                  <l>Servitii patiere jugum, tolerabis iniquas</l>
                  <l>Interius leges. Tunc omnia jure tenebis,</l>
                  <l>Cum poteris rex eſſe tui.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Thirdly, a reſolved mind, which weighs all
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169972:94"/> things judiciouſly, and provides for all occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is not ſo eaſily ſurpriſed with outward objects. Onely <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> wept not at the meeting with his wife, and ſon. I would beat thee (ſaid the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher) but that I am angry. One ſpake loweſt when he was moſt mooved. Another poured out the water when he was thirſty. Another made a Covenant with his eyes. Neither opportunity nor entiſement could prevail with <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Nor the Muſick, nor the fire with the three Children. It is not the ſtrength of the wind, but the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the chaff, which cauſeth it to be blown away. Outward objects do not impoſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, much leſs a Phyſicall neceſſity, they may be dangerous, but cannot be deſtructive to true liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>T. H.</label> 
                  <hi>THirdly, he diſputeth againſt the opinion of them that ſay, externall objects preſented to men of ſuch and ſuch temperatures, do make their actions neceſſary. And ſayes, the power that ſuch objects have over us, proceed from our own fault; But that is nothing to the purpoſe, if ſuch fault of ours proceedeth from cauſes, not in our own power. And therefore that opinion may hold true for all this anſwer: Further he ſaith, Prayer, Fasting, &amp;c. may alter our habits. 'Tis true, but when they do ſo, they are cauſes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary habit, and make it neceſſary; As the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer habit had been neceſſary, if Prayer, Faſting, &amp;c. had not been. Beſides we are not mooved, nor diſpoſed to prayer, or any other action but by outward objects, as pious company, godly preachers,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169972:94"/> or ſomething equivalent. Thirdly, he ſaith, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved mind is not eaſily ſurpriſed. As the mind of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> who when others wept, he alone wept not. And of the Philoſopher that abſtained from ſtriking, becauſe he found himſelf angry. And of him that poured out the water when he was thirſty; And the like; Such things I confeſs have, or may have been done, and do prove onely that it was not neceſſary for <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> then to weep, nor for the Philoſopher to ſtrike, nor for that other man to drink, but it does not prove that it was not neceſſary for <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> then to abſtaine, as he did from weeping, nor the Philoſopher to abſtain as he did from ſtriking; Nor the other man to forbear drinking. And yet that was the thing he ought to have proved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, he confeſſeth, that the diſpoſition of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may be dangerous to liberty, but cannot be deſtructive. To which I anſwer 'tis impoſſible; For, liberty is never in any other danger than to be loſt: And if it cannot be loſt, which he confeſſeth, I may infer it can be in no danger at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THe third pretenſe was out of morall Philophy miſunderſtood, that outward objects do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate the will. I ſhall not need to repeat what he hath omitted, but onely to ſatisfie his excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The firſt is, that it is not materiall, <hi>though the power of outward objects do proceed from our own faults, if ſuch faults of our proceed not from cauſes in our own power.</hi> Well, but what if they do proceed from cauſes that are in our own power, as in truth they do, then his anſwer is a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169972:95"/> meere ſubterfuge. If our faults proceed from cauſes that are not, and were not in our own power, then they are not our faults at all. It is not a fault in us not to do thoſe things, which never were in our power to do. But they are the faults of theſe cauſes from whence they do proceed. Next he confeſſeth, that it is in our power by good endeavours, to alter thoſe vitious habits which we had contracted, and to get the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry habit. <hi>True</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but then the contrary habit doth neceſſitate the one way, as well as the former habit did the other way.</hi> By which very conſideration it appeares, that that which he calls a neceſſity is no more but a proclivity. If it were a true neceſſity, it could not be avoided, nor altered by our endeavours. The truth is Acquired habits do help and aſſiſt the faculty; but they do not neceſſitate the faculty. He who hath gotten to himſelf an habit of temperance, may yet upon occaſion commit an intemperate act. And ſo on the contrary. Acts are not oppoſed to habits, but other habits. He addes, <hi>that we are not mooved to prayer or any other action but by outward objects, as pious company, godly Preachers, or ſomething equivalent.</hi> Wherein are two other miſtakes, firſt, to make godly Preachers, and pious company, to be outward <hi>objects,</hi> which are outward <hi>Agents.</hi> Secondly, to affirm that the will is not moved but by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward objects. The will is mooved by it ſelf, by the underſtanding, by the ſenſitive paſſions, by Angells good and bad, by men, and moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually by acts or habits infuſed by God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169972:95"/> the will is excited extraordinarily indeed, but efficaciouſly and determinately. This is more than equivalent with outward objects.</p>
               <p>Another branch of mine anſwer was, that a reſolved and prepared mind is able to reſiſt both, the appetibility of objects, and the unrulineſs of paſſions. As I ſhewed by examples. He anſwers that I prove <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> was not neceſſitated to weep, nor the Philoſopher to ſtrike, but I do not prove that they were not neceſſitated to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. He ſaith true. I am not now proving, but anſwering. Yet my anſwer doth ſufficiently prove that which I intend. That the rationall will hath power, both to ſleight the moſt appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible objects, and to controll the moſt unruly paſſions. When he hath given a clear ſolution to thoſe proofs which I have produced, then it will be time for him to cry for more work.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas I ſay, that outward objects may be dangerous, but cannot be deſtructive to true liberty. He catcheth at it, and objects that <hi>liberty is in no danger, but to be loſt, but I ſay, it cannot be loſt, therefore</hi> (he infers) <hi>that it is in no danger at all.</hi> I anſwer; Firſt, that liberty is in more danger to be abuſed than to be loſt. Many more men do abuſe their wits than loſe them. Secondly, liberty is in danger likewiſe to be weakened or diminiſhed, as when it is clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by vitious habits contracted by our ſelves, and yet it is not totally loſt. Thirdly, though liberty cannot be totally loſt out of the world, yet it may be totally loſt to this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, as to the exerciſe of it. Reaſon is the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169972:96"/> root of liberty, and though nothing be more naturall to a man than reaſon, yet many by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of ſtudy, or by continuall gurmandizing, or by ſome extravagant paſſion, which they have cheriſhed in themſelves, or by doting too much upon ſome affected object, do become very ſotts, and deprive themſelves of the uſe of reaſon, and conſequently of Liberty. And when the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of liberty is not thus univerſally loſt, yet it may be loſt reſpectively to this or that particular occaſion. As he who makes choiſe of a bad wife, hath loſt his former liberty to choſe a good one.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> FOurthly, the naturall Philoſopher doth teach, that the will doth neceſſarily follow the laſt dictate of the underſtanding. It is true indeed the will ſhould follow the direction of the underſtanding, but I am not ſatisfied that it doth evermore follow it. Sometimes this ſaying hath place, <hi>Video meliora probo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> Deteriora ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</hi> As that great Roman ſaid of two Sailers, that the one produced the better reaſons, but the other muſt have the office. So reaſon often lies deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at the feet of affection, Things neerer to the ſenſes moove more powerfully. Do what a man can, he ſhall ſorrow more for the death of his child, than for the ſin of his ſoul. Yet appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatively in the eſtimation of judgment, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the offence of God, a greater evill than any temporall loſs.</p>
               <p>Next, I do not believe that a man is bound to weigh the expedience or inexpedience of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169972:96"/> every ordinary triviall action to the leaſt grain in the ballance of his underſtanding, or to run up into his Watch-Tower with his perſpective to take notice of every Jack-daw that flies by, for fear of ſome hidden danger. This ſeemes to me to be a proſtitution of reaſon to petite obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as concerning every rag that a man weares, each drop of drink, each morſell of bread that he eates, each pace that he walks. Thus many ſtepps muſt he go, not one more, nor one leſs, under pain of mortall ſin. What is this but a Rack and a Gibbet to the Conſcience? But God leaves many things indifferent, though man be ſo curious he will not. A good Architect will be ſure to provide ſufficient materialls for his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but what particular number of ſtones, or trees, he troubles not his head. And ſuppoſe he ſhould weigh each action thus, yet he doth not, ſo ſtill there is liberty. Thirdly, I conceive it is poſſible in this miſt and weakneſs of human ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, for two actions to be ſo equally cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated, that no diſcernible difference can appear between them upon diſcuſſion. As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Chirurgion ſhould give two plaiſters to his Patient, and bid him apply either of them to his wound, what can induce his reaſon more to the one than to the other, but that he may refer it to chance, whether he will uſe? But leaving theſe probable ſpeculations which I ſubmit to better judgments, I anſwer the Philoſopher brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus; Admitting that the will did neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the laſt dictate of the underſtanding as certainly in many things it doth. Yet,</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:169972:97"/>
               <p>Firſt, this is no extrinſecall determination from without, and a mans own reſolution is not deſtructive to his own liberty, but depends upon it. So the perſon is ſtill free.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this determination is not antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but joyned with the action. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the will, are not different Agents, but diſtinct faculties of the ſame ſoul. Here is an infallibility, or an hypotheticall neceſſity, as we ſay, <hi>Quicquid eſt quando eſt, neceſſe eſt eſſe:</hi> A neceſſity of conſequence, but not a neceſſity of conſequent. Though an Agent have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined, and ſo the action be become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, yet if the Agent did determine freely, the action likewiſe is free.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>T. H.</label> 
                  <hi>THE fourth opinion which he rejecteth, is of them that make the will neceſſarily to follow the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, but it ſeems he underſtands, that Tenet in another ſenſe than I do. For he ſpeaketh as if they that held it did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe men muſt diſpute the ſequell of every action they do, great &amp; ſmall, to the leaſt grain, which is a thing, that he thinks with reaſon to be untrue. But I underſtand it to ſignifie, that the will followes the laſt opinion or judgment, immediatly preceding the action, concerning whether it be good to do it or not, whether he hath weighed it long before or not all. And that I take to be the meaning of them that hold it. As for example, when a man ſtrikes, his will to ſtrike followes neceſſarily that thought he had of the ſequell of his ſtroke immediately before the lifting of his hand. Now
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169972:97"/> if it be underſtood in that ſenſe, the laſt dictate of the underſtanding does certainly neceſſitate the action, though not as the whole cauſe, yet as the laſt cauſe, as the laſt feather neceſſitates the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an horſes-back, when there are ſo many laid on before, as there needeth but the addition of that one to make the weight ſufficient. That which he alledgeth againſt this, is firſt, out of a Poet, who in the perſon of <hi>Medaea</hi> ſayes, <hi>Video Meliora proboque, Deteriora ſequor.</hi> But the ſaying (as pretty as it is) is not true, for though <hi>Medaea</hi> ſaw many reaſons to forbear killing her children, yet the laſt dictate of her judgment was, that the preſent revenge of her husband out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed them all. And thereupon that wicked action followed neceſſarily. Then the ſtory of the Romans, that of two competitors ſaid, one had the better reaſons, but the other muſt have the office. This alſo maketh againſt him, for the laſt dictate of his judgment, that had the beſtowing of the office was this, that it was better to take a great bribe, than reward a great merit. Thirdly, he objects that things neerer the ſenſes moove more powerfully than reaſon. What followeth thence but this, That the ſenſe of the preſent good is commonly more immediate to the Action, than the foreſight of the evill conſequents to come. Fourthly, whereas he ſayes, that do what a man can, he ſhall ſorrow more for the death of his ſon, than for the ſin of his ſoul; it makes nothing to the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, but it argues plainly, that ſorrow for ſin is not voluntary. And by conſequence repentance proceedeth from cauſes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THE fourth pretenſe alledged againſt Liberty was, that the will doth neceſſarily follow the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is largely anſwered before in ſeverall places of this Reply, and particularly, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. In my former diſcourſe, I gave two anſwers to it: The one certain and undoubted, That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the laſt dictate of the underſtanding did alwayes determine the will, yet this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being not antecedent in time, nor procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from extrinſecall cauſes, but from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſolution of the Agent, who had now freely determined himſelf, it makes no abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but onely hypotheticall, upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Agent hath determined his own will, after this or that manner. Which being the main anſwer, <hi>T. H.</hi> is ſo farr from taking it away, that he takes no notice of it. The other part of mine anſwer was probable; That it is not alwayes certain, that the will doth alwayes actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally follow the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, though it alwayes ought to follow it. Of which I gave then three reaſons, one was, that actions may be ſo equally circumſtantiated, or the caſe ſo intricate, that reaſon cannot give a poſitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but leaves the election to liberty or chance. To this he anſwers not a word. Another of my reaſons was, becauſe reaſon doth not weigh, nor is bound to weigh the convenience or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of every individuall action to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt grain in the balance of true judgement. The truth of this reaſon is confeſſed by <hi>T. H.</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:169972:98"/> though he might have had more abetters in this than in the moſt part of his diſcourſe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is indifferent, that a man cannot ſtroak his beard on one ſide, but it was either neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to do it, or ſinfull to omit it, from which confeſſion of his, it followes, that in all thoſe actions, wherein reaſon doth not define what is moſt convenient, there the will is free from the determination of the underſtanding. And by conſequence the laſt feather is wanting to break the horſes back; A third reaſon was, becauſe paſſions and affections ſometimes prevail againſt judgment, as I prooved by the example of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by the neerneſs of the objects to the ſenſes, and by the eſtimation of a temporall loſs more than ſin. Againſt this reaſon, his whole anſwer is addreſſed. And firſt, he explaneth the ſenſe of the aſſertion by the compariſon of the laſt feather, wherewith he ſeems to be delighted, ſeeing he uſeth it now the ſecond time. But let him like it as he will, it is improper for three reaſons; Firſt, the determination of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no part of the weight, but is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the trier. The underſtanding weigheth all Things, Objects, Means, Circumſtances, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, Inconvenience, but it ſelf is not weighed. Secondly, the ſenſitive paſſion in in ſome extraordinary caſes, may give a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit weight to the object, if it can detein or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert reaſon from the ballance, but ordinarily the Means, Circumſtances, and Cauſes concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent they have their whole weight from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. So as they do not preſs the horſes
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169972:99"/> back at all untill reaſon lay them on. Thirdly, he conceives that as each feather hath a certain naturall weight, whereby it concurres not arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, but neceſſarily towards the overcharging of the horſe; So all objects and cauſes have a naturall efficiency whereby they do Phyſically determin the will, which is a great miſtake. His Objects, his Agents, his Motives, his Paſſions, and all his concurrent cauſes, ordinarily do one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moove the will morally, not determine it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally. So as it hath in all ordinary actions a free dominion over it ſelf.</p>
               <p>His other example of a man that ſtrikes, <hi>whoſe will to ſtrike followeth neceſſarily that thought he had of the ſequell of his ſtroke immediately before the lifting up of his hand)</hi> as it confounds paſſionate, indeliberate thoughts, with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of right reaſon. So it is very uncertain, for between the cup and the lipps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lifting up of the hand, and the blow, the will may alter, and the judgment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And laſtly, it is impertinent, for that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſtriking proceeds from the free determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Agent, and not from the ſpeciall influence of any outward determining cauſes. And ſo it is onely a neceſſity upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Medaeas</hi> choiſe, the ſtrength of the argument doth not lye either in the fact of <hi>Medaea,</hi> which is but a fiction, or in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Poet, who writes things rather to be admired than believed, but in the experience of all men, who find it to be true in themſelves.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169972:99"/> That ſometimes reaſon doth ſhew unto a man the exorbitancy of his paſſion, that what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires is but a pleaſant good, that what he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by ſuch a choiſe is an honeſt good, That that which is honeſt is to be preferred before that which is pleaſant, yet the will purſues that which is pleaſant, and neglects that which is honeſt. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith as much in earneſt as is feined of <hi>Medaea.</hi> That <hi>he approoved not that which he did, and</hi> that <hi>he did that which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> Rom. 7.15. The Roman Story is miſtaken; There was no bribe in the caſe but affection. Whereas I urge that thoſe things, which are nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the ſenſes do moove more powerfully, he layes hold on it; and without anſwering to that for which I produced it, infers, <hi>That the ſenſe of preſent good is more immediate to the action than the foreſight of evill conſequents.</hi> Which is true, but it is not abſolutely true by any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent neceſſity. Let a man do what he may do, and what he ought to do, and ſenſitive objects will loſe that power which they have by his own fault, and neglect. Antecedent or indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate concupiſcence doth ſometimes (but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſurpriſe a man, and render the action not free. But conſequent and deliberated concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which proceeds from the rationall will doth render the action more free, not leſs free, and introduceth onely a neceſſity upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he ſaith, that <hi>a mans mourning more for the loſs of his Child than for his ſin, makes nothing to the laſt dictate of the underſtanding.</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:169972:100"/> Yes, very much. Reaſon dictates, that a ſin committed, is a greater evill than the loſs of a child, and ought more to be lamented for, yet we ſee daily how affection prevailes againſt the dictate of reaſon; That which he inferrs from hence, that <hi>ſorrow for ſin is not voluntary, and by conſequence that repentance proceedeth from cauſes,</hi> is true, as to the latter part of it, but not in his ſenſe. The cauſes from whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth proceed are Gods grace preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and mans will concurring. God prevents freely, man concurs freely. Thoſe inferiour Agents, which ſometimes do concur as ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the grace of God, do not, cannot, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the will naturally. And therefore the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his inference, that ſorrow for ſin is not voluntary, is untrue, and altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. That is much more truly, and much more properly ſaid to be voluntary, which proceeds from judgment, and from the rationall will, than that which proceeds from paſſion, and from the ſenſitive will. One of the main grounds of all <hi>T. H.</hi> his errours in this queſtion is, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no efficacy, but that which is naturall. Hence is this wild conſequence, <hi>Repentance hath cauſes,</hi> and therefore <hi>it is not voluntary.</hi> Free effects have free cauſes, neceſſary effects neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſes, voluntary effects have ſometimes free, ſometimes neceſſary cauſes.</p>

               <p>Secondly, in my poor judgment, which I ever do &amp; ever ſhall ſubmit to better, the readieſt way to reconcile Contingence and Liberty, with the decrees and preſcience of God, and moſt remote from the altercations of theſe times, is to ſubject future co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingents to the aſpects of God, according to that preſentiallity which they have in eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Not that things future, which are not yet exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent &amp; coexiſtent with God, but becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite knowledge of God, incircling all times in the point of eternity, doth attain to their future Being, from whence proceeds their objective and intelligible Being. The main impediment which keeps men from ſubſcribing to this way is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conceive eternity to be an everlaſting ſucceſſion, and not one indiviſible point. But if they conſider, that whatſoever is in God is God, That there are no accidents in him, for that which is infinitely perfect cannot be further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. That as God is not wiſe but Wiſedom
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169972:101"/> it ſelf, not juſt but Juſtice it ſelf, ſo he is not eternall but Eternity it ſelf. They muſt needs conclude that therefore this eternity is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe God is indiviſible, and therefore not ſucceſſive, but altogether an infinite point, comprehending all times within it ſelf.</p>

                  <hi>THE laſt part of this diſcourſe conteineth his opinion about reconciling Liberty with the Preſcience, and Decrees of God, otherwiſe than ſome Divines have done, againſt whom he had formerly written a Treatiſe, out of which he only repeateth two things. One is, that we ought not to deſert a certain truth, for not being able to comprehend the certain manner of it. And I ſay the ſame, as for example, that he ought not to deſert this certain truth; That there are certain and neceſſary cauſes, which make every man to will what he willeth, though he do not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in what manner the will of man is cauſed. And yet I think the manner of it, is not very hard to conceive, ſeeing that we ſee daily, that praiſe, diſpraiſe, reward, puniſhment, good and evill, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quells of mens actions retained in memory, do frame and make us to the election of whatſoever it be that we elect. And that the memory of ſuch things proceeds from the ſenſes. And ſenſe from the operation of the objects of ſenſe, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall to us, and governed onely by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And by conſequence, all actions, even of free and voluntary Agents are neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other thing he repeateth is, that the beſt way to reconcile Contingency and Liberty, with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169972:101"/> the preſcience and decrees of God, is to ſubject fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contingents to the aſpect of God. The ſame is alſo my opinion, but contrary to what he hath all this while laboured to prove. For, hitherto he held liberty and neceſſity, that is to ſay, liberty and the decrees of God irreconcilable, unleſs the aſpect of God (which word appeareth now the firſt time in this diſcourſe) ſignifie ſomewhat els be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Gods will and decree, which I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. But he adds, that we muſt ſubject them according to that preſentiality which they have in eternity, which he ſayes cannot be done by them that conceive eternity to be an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſucceſſion, but onely by them that conceive it an indiviſible point. To this I anſwer, that as ſoon as I can conceive Eternity an indiviſible point, or any thing, but an everlaſting ſucceſſion, I will renounce all I have written in this ſubject: I know <hi>St. Thomas Aquinas</hi> calls eternity <hi>Nunc ſtans,</hi> an ever abiding now, which is eaſy enough to ſay, but though I fain would, I never could conceive it. They that can, are more happy than I. But in the mean time he alloweth hereby all men to be of my opinion, ſave onely thoſe that conceive in their minds a <hi>nunc ſtans,</hi> which I think are none. I underſtand as little how it can be true that God is not juſt, but Juſtice it ſelf, not wiſe but Wiſedom it ſelf, not eternall but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf. Nor how he concludes thence, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is a ponit indiviſible, and not a ſucceſſion. Nor in what ſenſe it can be ſaid, that an infinite point, &amp;c. wherein is no ſucceſſion, can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all times, though time be ſucceſſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:169972:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe phraſes I find not in the Scripture. I wonder therefore, what was the deſigne of the School-men, to bring them up, unleſs they thought a man could not be a true Chriſtian, unleſs his underſtanding be firſt ſtrangled with ſuch hard ſayings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus much in anſwer to his diſcourſe, wherein I think not onely his ſquadrons, but alſo his reſerves of diſtinctions are defeated. And now your Lordſhip ſhall have my doctrine concerning the ſame queſtion, with my reaſons for it poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly as I can, without any tearmes of Art in plain Engliſh.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THat poor diſcourſe which I mention, was not written againſt any Divines, but in way of examination of a French Treatiſe, which your Lordſhips Brother did me the honour to ſhew me at <hi>York;</hi> My aſſertion is moſt true, that we ought not to deſert a certain truth, becauſe we are not able to comprehend the certain manner. Such a truth is that which I maintain, that the will of man in ordinary actions is free from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall determination. A truth demonſtrable in reaſon, received and believed by all the world. And therefore though I be not able to comprehend or expreſs exactly the certain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it conſiſts together with Gods Eternall Preſcience, and Decrees, which exceed my weak capacity, yet I ought to adhere to that truth, which is manifeſt. But <hi>T. H.</hi> his opinion of the abſoute neceſſity of all events, by reaſon of their antecedent determination in their extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169972:102"/> and neceſſary cauſes, is no ſuch certain Truth, but an innovation, a ſtrange paradox, without probable grounds, rejected by all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, yea, by all the world. Neither, is the manner how the ſecond cauſes do operate ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, or ſo tranſcendent above the reach of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Eternall Decrees of God are. And therefore in both theſe reſpects he cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ſame priviledge. I am in profeſſion of an old truth derived by inheritance or ſucceſſion from mine anceſtors. And therefore, though I were not able to clear every quirk in Law, yet I might juſtly hold my poſſeſſion untill a better title were ſhewed for another. He is no old Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, but a new Pretender, and is bound to make good his claime by evident proofs, not by weak and inconſequent ſuppoſitions, or inducements, ſuch as thoſe are which he uſeth here, of <hi>praiſes, diſpraiſes, rewards, puniſhments, the memory of good and evill ſequells, and events,</hi> which may incline the will, but neither can nor do neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the will. Nor by uncertain and accidentall inferences ſuch as this, <hi>The memory of praiſes, diſpraiſes, rewards, puniſhments, good and evill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelis do make us</hi> (he ſhould ſay diſpoſe us) <hi>to elect what we elect, but the memory of theſe things is from the ſenſe, and the ſenſe from the operation of the externall objects, and the Agency of externall octjects is onely from God, therefore all actions, even of free and voluntary Agents, are neceſſary.</hi> To paſs by all the other great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, which are to be found in this Sorite. It is juſt like that old Sophiſticall piece: He
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169972:103"/> that drinks well, ſleeps well, he that ſleeps well, thinks no hurt, he that thinks no hurt lives well, therefore he that drinks well lives well.</p>
               <p>In the very laſt paſſage of my diſcourſe, I propoſed mine own private opinion, how it might be made appear, that the Eternall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Decrees of God are conſiſtent with true liberty and contingency. And this I ſet down, in as plain tearmes as I could, or as ſo profound a ſpeculation would permit, which is almoſt wholly miſunderſtood by <hi>T. H.</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my words wreſted to a wrong ſenſe. As firſt, where I ſpeak of the aſpect of God, that is his view, his knowledge, by which the moſt free and contingent actions were manifeſt to him from eternity, Heb. 4.11. <hi>All things are naked and open to his eyes,</hi> and this not diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, but intuitively, not by externall ſpecies, but by his internall Eſſence; He confounds this with the Will, and the Decrees of God: Though he found not the word <hi>Aſpect</hi> before in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he might have found preſcience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he chargeth me that hitherto I have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that <hi>Liberty and the Decrees of God, are irreconcilable.</hi> If I have ſaid any ſuch thing, my heart never went along with my pen. No, but his reaſon why he chargeth me on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is becauſe I have maintained, that <hi>Liberty and the abſolute neceſſity of all things are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliable.</hi> That is true indeed. What then? <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Neceſſity and Gods Decrees are all one.</hi> How all one? that were ſtrange indeed.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169972:103"/> Neceſſity may be a conſequent of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, it cannot be the Decree it ſelf. But to cut his argument ſhort. God hath decreed all effects which come to paſs in time, yet not all after the ſame manner, but according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct natures, capacities and conditions of his creatures, which he doth not deſtroy by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; Some he acteth, with ſome he coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by ſpeciall influence, and ſome he onely permitteth. Yet this is no idle or bare permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing he doth concurre both by way of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall influence, giving power to act, and alſo by diſpoſing all events neceſſary, free, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent to his own glory. Thirdly, he chargeth me, that <hi>I allow all men to be of his opinion, ſave onely thoſe that conceive in their minds a</hi> Nunc ſtans, <hi>or how eternity is an indiviſible point, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an everlaſting ſucceſſion.</hi> But I have given no ſuch allowance. I know, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wayes propoſed by Divines, for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the Eternall Preſcience, and Decrees of God, with the Liberty and Contingency of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, ſome of which may pleaſe other judgments better than this of mine. Howſoever, though a man could comprehend none of all theſe wayes, yet remember what I ſaid, that a certain truth ought not to be rejected, becauſe we are not able, in reſpect of our weakneſs, to underſtand the certain manner, or reaſon of it. I know, the Load-ſtone hath an attractive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to draw the Iron to it; And yet I know not how it comes to have ſuch a power.</p>
               <p>But the chiefeſt difficulty, which offers it ſelf in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169972:104"/> this Section is, whether Eternity be an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible point (as I maintain it) or an everlaſting ſucceſſion; as he would have it. According to his conſtant uſe, he gives no anſwer to what was urged by me, but pleads againſt it from his own incapacity. <hi>I never could conceive, ſaith he, how eternity ſhould be an indiviſible point.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that neither we, nor any man els can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it ſo cleerly, as we do theſe inferiour things. The neerer that any thing comes to the eſſence of God, the more remote it is from our apprehenſion. But ſhall we therefore make po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentialities, and ſucceſſive duration, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and later, or a part without a part (as they ſay) to be in God? Becauſe we are not able to underſtand cleerly the divine perfection, we muſt not therefore attribute any imperfection to him.</p>
               <p>He ſaith moreover, that <hi>he underſtands as little how it can be true which I ſay, that God is not juſt but Juſtice it ſelf, not eternall but Eternity it ſelf.</hi> It ſeemes howſoever he be verſed in this queſtion, that he hath not troubled his head over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much with reading School-Divines, or Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicians, if he make faculties or qualities to be in God, really diſtinct-from his eſſence. God is a moſt ſimple or pure act, which can admit no compoſition of ſubſtance and accidents. Doth he think that the moſt perfect Eſſence of God cannot act ſufficiently without faculties and qualities? The infinite perfection of the Divine eſſence, excludes all paſſive or receptive powers, and cannot be perfected more than it is by any
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169972:104"/> accidents. The attributes of God, are not divers vertues, or qualities in him, as they are in the creatures, but really one and the ſame, with the Divine Eſſence, and among themſelves. They are attributed to God, to ſupply the defect of our capacity, who are not able to underſtand that which is to be known of God, under one name, or one act of the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he ſaith, that <hi>he underſtands not how I conclude from hence, that Eternity is an indiviſible point, and not a ſucceſſion.</hi> I will help him. The Divine Subſtance is indiviſible; But Eternity is the Divine Subſtance. The major is evident, becauſe God is <hi>actus ſimpliciſſimus,</hi> a moſt ſimple act, wherein there is no manner of compoſition, neither of matter and forme, nor of ſubject and accidents, nor of parts, &amp;c. and by conſequence no diviſibility. The minor hath been cleerly demonſtrated in mine anſwer to his laſt doubt, and is confeſſed by all men, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in God, is God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly he ſaith. He conceives not <hi>how it can be ſaid, that an infinite point, wherein is no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, can comprehend all time which is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive.</hi> I anſwer, that it doth not comprehend it formally as time is ſucceſſive, but eminently and virtually, as Eternity is infinite. To day all Eternity is coexiſtent with this day. To morrow all Eternity will be coexiſtent with to morrow, and ſo in like manner with all the parts of time, being it ſelf without parts. He ſaith, <hi>He finds not theſe phraſes in the Scripture.</hi> No, but he may find the thing in the Scripture, that God is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169972:105"/> infinite in all his attributes, and not capable of any imperfection.</p>
               <p>And ſo to ſhew his antipathy againſt the School-men, that he hath no liberty or power to contain himſelf, when he meets with any of of their phraſes or tenets, he falls into another paroxiſme or fit of inveighing againſt them; And ſo concludes his anſwer with a <hi>plaudite</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he had defeated both my ſquadrons of arguments, and reſerves of diſtinctions,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Dicite Io Paean, &amp; Io bis dicite Paean.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>But becauſe his eye-ſight was weak, and their backs were towards him, he quite miſtook the matter. Thoſe whom he ſee rowted and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away were his own ſcattered forces.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>FIrſt, I conceive that when it cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mans mind, to do or not to do ſome certain action, if he have no time to deliberate the doing or abſtaining, neceſſarily followeth the preſent thought he had of the good or evill conſequence thereof to himſelf. As for example, in ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain anger the action ſhall follow the thought of of revenge, in ſuddain fear the thought of eſcape. Alſo when a man hath time to deliberate, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates not, becauſe never any thing appeared, that could make him doubt of the conſequence, the action followes his opinion of the goodneſs or harm of it. Theſe actions I call voluntary. He, if I underſtand him aright, calls them Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I call them voluntary, becauſe thoſe actions that follow immediatly the laſt appetite are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169972:105"/> And here where there is one onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, that one is the laſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Beſides, I ſee 'tis reaſonable to puniſh a raſh acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which could not be juſtly done by man, unleſs the ſame were voluntary: For no action of a man can be ſaid to be without deliberation, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſuddain, becauſe 'tis ſuppoſed he had time to deliberate all the precedent time of his life, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould do that kind of action or not. And hence it is, that he that killeth in a ſuddain paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of anger, ſhall nevertheleſs be juſtly put to death, becauſe all the time wherein he was able to conſider, whether to kill were good or evill, ſhall be held for one continuall deliberation, and conſequently the killing ſhall be judged to proceed from election.</hi>

                  <label>J. D.</label> THis part of <hi>T. H.</hi> his diſcourſe hangs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a ſick mans dreames. Even now he tells us, that <hi>a man may have time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet not deliberate;</hi> By and by he ſaith, that <hi>no action of a man, though never ſo ſuddain, can be ſaid to be without deliberation.</hi> He tells us Numb. 33. that <hi>the ſcope</hi> of this ſection is <hi>to ſhew what is ſpontaneous.</hi> Howbeit he ſheweth onely what is voluntary; ſo making voluntary and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous to be all one, whereas before he had told us, that <hi>every ſpontaneous action is not voluntary, becauſe indeliberate. Nor every voluntary action ſpontaneous, if it proceed from fear.</hi> Now he tells us, that <hi>thoſe actions, which follow the laſt appetite, are voluntary, and where there is one onely appetite, that is the laſt.</hi> But
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169972:106"/> before he told us, that <hi>voluntary praeſuppoſeth ſome praecedent deliberation and Meditation of what is likely to follow, both upon the doing and abſtaining from the action.</hi> He defines Liberty, Numb. 29. to be <hi>the abſence of all extrinſecall impediments to action.</hi> And yet in his whole diſcourſe he laboureth to make good, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not done, is therefore not done, becauſe the Agent was neceſſitated by extrinſecall cauſes not to do it. Are not extrinſecall cauſes, which determine him not to do it, extrinſecall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to action. So no man ſhall be free to do any thing, but that which he doth actually. He defines a free Agent to be <hi>him, who hath not made an end of deliberating,</hi> Numb. 28. And yet defines liberty to be <hi>an abſence of outward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments.</hi> There may be outward impediments, even whileſt he is deliberating. As a man deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berates whether he ſhall play at Tennis, and at the ſame time the door of the Tennis-court is faſt locked againſt him. And after a man hath cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliberate, there may be no outward impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, as when a man reſolves not to play at Tennis, becauſe he finds himſelf ill diſpoſed, or becauſe he will not hazard his mony. So the ſame perſon, at the ſame time, ſhould be free and not free, not free and free. And as he is not firme to his own grounds, ſo he confounds all things, the <hi>mind</hi> and the <hi>will,</hi> the <hi>estimative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> and the <hi>underſtanding, imagination</hi> with <hi>deliberation,</hi> the end with the means, humane <hi>will</hi> with the <hi>ſenſitive appetite, rationall hope or fear,</hi> with <hi>irrationall paſſions, inclinations</hi> with <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:169972:106"/> A <hi>beginning of Being</hi> with a <hi>beginning of working. Sufficiency</hi> with <hi>efficiency.</hi> So as the greateſt difficulty is to find out what he aimes at. So as I had once reſolved not to anſwer this part of his diſcourſe, yet upon better adviſe, I will take a brief ſurvey of it alſo; and ſhew how far I aſſent unto, or diſſent from that which I conceive to be his meaning.</p>
               <p>And firſt, concerning ſuddain paſſions, as Anger or the like; That which he ſaith, that <hi>the action doth neceſſarily follow the thought,</hi> is thus far true, that thoſe actions, which are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether undeliberated and do proceed from ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and violent paſſions, or <hi>motus primo primis,</hi> which ſurpriſe a man, and give him no time to adviſe with reaſon, are not properly and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in themſelves free, but rather neceſſary actions, as when a man runs away from a Cat or a Cuſtard, out of a ſecret antipathy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for thoſe actions <hi>wherein actuall deliberation ſeemes not neceſſary, becauſe never any thing appeared that could make a man doubt of the conſequence.</hi> I do confeſs, that actions done by vertue of a precedent deliberation, without any actuall deliberation in the preſent when the act is done, may notwithſtanding be truly, both voluntary and free acts, yea, in ſome caſes, and in ſome ſenſe more free, than if they were actually deliberated of in preſent. As one who hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by former deliberation and experience, an habit to play upon the Virginall, needs not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate what man, or what Jack he much touch, nor what finger of his hand he muſt move to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169972:107"/> play ſuch a leſſon; Yea, if his mind ſhould be fixed, or intent to every motion of his hand, or every touch of a ſtring, it would hinder his play, and render the action more troubleſome to him. Wherefore I believe, that not onely his playing in generall, but every motion of his hand, though it be not preſently deliberated of, is a free act, by reaſon of his precedent deliberation. So then (ſaving improprieties of ſpeech, as calling that voluntary which is free, and limiting the will to the laſt appetite, and other miſtakes, as that no act can be ſaid to be without deliberation) we agree alſo for the greater part in this ſecond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he ſaith, that <hi>ſome ſuddain acts, proceeding from violent paſſions, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe a man, are juſtly puniſhed,</hi> I grant they are ſo ſometimes, but not for his reaſon, becauſe they have been formerly actually deliberated of, but becauſe they were virtually deliberated of, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is our faults, that they were not actually deliberated of, whether it was a fault of pure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that is, of not doing our duty onely, or a fault of bad diſpoſition alſo, by reaſon of ſome vitious habit, which we had contracted by our former actions. To do a neceſſary act is never a fault, nor juſtly puniſhable, when the neceſſity is inevitably impoſed upon us by extrinſecall cauſes. As if a child before he had the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall kill a man in his paſſion, yet becauſe he wanted malice to incite him to it, and reaſon to reſtrain him from it, he ſhall not dy for it in the ſtrict rules of particular Juſtice, unleſs there
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169972:107"/> be ſome mixture of publick Juſtice in the caſe. But if the neceſſity be contracted by our ſelves, and by our own faults, it is juſtly puniſhable. As he who by his wanton thoughts in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, doth procure his own nocturnall pollution. A man cannot deliberate in his ſleep, yet it is accounted a ſinfull act, and conſequently, a free act, that is not actually free in its ſelf, but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually free in its cauſes, and though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly willed and choſen, yet it is tacitely and implicitely willed and choſen, when that is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and choſen from whence it was neceſſarily produced. By the Leviticall Law, if a man digged a pit, and left it uncovered, ſo that his neighbours Oxe, or his Aſſe, did fall into it, he was bound to make reparation, not becauſe he did choſe to leave it uncovered on purpoſe that ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance might happen, but becauſe he did freely omit, that which he ought to have done, from whence this dammage proceeded to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Laſtly, there is great difference between the firſt motions, which ſometimes are not in our power, and ſubſequent acts of killing or ſtealing, or the like, which alwaies are in our power, if we have the uſe of reaſon, or els it is our own fault, that they are not in our power. Yet to ſuch haſty acts done in hot blood, the Law is not ſo ſevere, as to thoſe which are done upon long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and prepenſed malice, unleſs (as I ſaid) there be ſome mixture of publick Juſtice in it. He that ſteales an horſe deliberately may be more puniſhable by the Law, than he that kills the owner by Chance-medley. Yet the death of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169972:108"/> the owner was more noxious (to uſe his phraſe) and more dammageable to the family, than the ſtealth of the horſe. So far was <hi>T.

                  <hi>SEcondly, I conceive when a man deliberates, whether he ſhall do a thing or not do a thing, that he does nothing els but conſider, whether it be better for himſelf to do it, or not to do it. And to conſider an action, is to imagine the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, both good and evill, from whence is to be inferred, that deliberation is nothing but alternate imagination, of the good and evill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quells of an action or (which is the ſame thing) alternate hope and fear, or alternate appetite to do, or quit the action of which he delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</hi>

All other appetites to do and to quit, that come upon a man during his deliberation, are uſually called intentions, and inclinations, but not wills, there being but one will, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this caſe may be called laſt will, though the intention change often.</hi>

He makes the intention, which is a moſt proper and elicite act of the will, <hi>or a willing of the end, as it is to be attained by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain means,</hi> to be no willing at all, but onely ſome antecedaneous <hi>inclination</hi> or propenſion.

But the groſſeſt miſtake is, that he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no act of a mans will, to be his will, but onely the laſt act, which he calls the laſt will. If the firſt were no will, how comes this to be the laſt will? According to this doctrine, the will of a man ſhould be as unchangeable as the Will of God, at leaſt ſo long as there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to effect it. According to this doctrine
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169972:109"/> concupiſcence with conſent ſhould be no ſin, for that which is not truly willed is not a ſin; Or rather ſhould not be at all, unleſs either the act followed, or were rendred impoſſible by ſome intervening circumſtances. According to this doctrine no man can ſay, this is my will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knowes not yet, whether it ſhall be his laſt appeal. The truth is, there be many acts of the will, both in reſpect of the means, and of the end. But that act, which makes a mans actions to be truly free, is Election, which is the <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate choſing or refuſing, of this or that means, or the acceptation of one means before another, where divers are repreſented by the underſtanding.</hi>

A free act is onely that which proceeds from the free election of the rationall will after deliberation, but every act that proceeds from the ſenſitive appetite of man or beaſt, without deliberation or election, is truly voluntary. The other thing obſervable is his concluſion, that <hi>it is all one to ſay, a man is free, and to ſay, he hath
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169972:109"/> not made an end of deliberating.</hi> Which confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his, overturnes his whole ſtructure of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, for if every Agent be neceſſitated to act what he doth act by a neceſſary and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall flux of extrinſecall cauſes, then he is no more free before he deliberates, or whileſt he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates, than he is after, but by <hi>T.

Aſcribing the neceſſitation of a man in free acts to his own deliberation, and in indeliberate acts to his laſt thought, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. what is this to a naturall and ſpeciall influence of extrinſecall cauſes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Liberty</hi> (ſaith he) is <hi>an abſence of extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall impediments,</hi> but deliberation doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no new extrinſecall impediments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (let him choſe which part he will) either he is free after deliberation, by his own doctrine, or he was not free before. Our own deliberation, and the direction of our own underſtanding, and the election of our own will, do produce an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheticall neceſſity, that the event be ſuch as the underſtanding hath directed, and the will ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But forasmuch as the underſtanding might have directed otherwiſe, and the will have elected otherwiſe, this is far from an abſolute neceſſity. Neither doth liberty reſpect onely future acts, but preſent acts alſo. Otherwiſe God did not freely create the world. In the ſame inſtant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                  <hi>FIftly, I conceive liberty to be rightly defined in this manner. Liberty is the abſence of all the impediments to action, that are not contained in the nature, and in the intrinſecall quality of the Agent. As for example, the water is ſaid to deſcend freely, or to have liberty to deſcend by the Chanell of the River, becauſe there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment that way, but not acroſs, becauſe the banks are impediments. And though water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcend, yet men never ſay it wants the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to aſcend, but the faculty or power, becauſe the impediment is in the nature of the water and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall. So alſo we ſay, he that is tied wants the liberty to go, becauſe the impediment is not in him, but in his hands, where as we ſay not ſo of him that is ſick or lame, becauſe the impediment is in himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> HOw that ſhould be a right definition of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which comprehends neither the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus nor the difference, neither the matter nor the forme of liberty, which doth not ſo much as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally deſcribe liberty by its marks and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens; How a reall faculty or the Elective power ſhould be defined by a negation, or by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abſence, is paſt my underſtanding, and contrary
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169972:110"/> to all the rules of right Reaſon, which I have learned. Negatives cannot explicate the nature of things defined. By this definition, a ſtone hath liberty to aſcend into the aire, becauſe there is no outward impediment to hinder it, and ſo a violent act may be a free act. Juſt like his definition are his inſtances of the liberty of the water to deſcend down the Channell, and a ſick or a lame mans liberty to goe. The later is an impotence and not a power or a liberty. The former is ſo far from being a free act, that it is ſcarce a naturall act, Certainly, the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion of water, as of all heavy bodies, is to deſcend directly downwards towards the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as we ſee in rain, which falls down perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly. Though this be far from a free act, which proceeds from a rationall appetite, yet it is a naturall act, and proceeds from a naturall appetite, and hath its reaſon within in ſelf. So hath not the current of the River in its chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, which muſt not be aſcribed to the proper nature of the water, but either to the generall order of the univerſe, for the better being and preſervation of the creatures (otherwiſe the waters ſhould not moove in Seas and Rivers as they do, but cover the face of the earth, and poſſeſs their proper place between the aire and the earth, according to the degree of their gravity.) Or to an extrinſecall principle, whileſt one particle of water thruſteth and forceth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, and ſo comes a current, or at leaſt ſo comes the current to be more impetuous, to which motion the poſition of the earth doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169972:111"/> much, both by reſtraining that fluid body with its banks from diſperſing it ſelf, and alſo, by affording way for a faire and eaſy deſcent by its proclivity. He tells us ſadly that <hi>the water wants liberty to go over the banks, becauſe there is an extrinſecall impediment, But to aſcend up the channell it wants not liberty, but power.</hi> Why? Liberty is a power, if it want power to aſcend, it wants liberty to aſcend. But he makes the reaſon why the water aſcends not up the channell, to be intrinſecall, and the reaſon why it aſcends not over the banks to be extrinſecall, as if there were not a riſing of the ground up the channell, as well as up the banks, though it be not ſo diſcernible, nor alwayes ſo ſudden. The naturall appetite of the water is as much againſt the aſcending over the banks, as the aſcending up the channell. And the extrinſecall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as great in aſcending up the channell as over the banks, or rather greater, becauſe there it muſt moove, not onely againſt the riſing ſoile, but alſo againſt the ſucceeding waters, which preſs forward the former. Either the River wants liberty for both, or els it wans liberty for neither.</p>
               <p>But to leave his metaphoricall faculties, and his Catachreſticall Liberty. How far is his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe wide from the true morall liberty, which is in queſtion between us. His former deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a free Agent, that is, <hi>he who hath not made an end of deliberating,</hi> though it was wide from the mark, yet it came much neerer the truth than this definition of Liberty, unleſs perhaps he think that the water hath done deliberating,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169972:111"/> whether it will go over the banks, but hath not done deliberating, whether it will go up the channell.</p>

                  <hi>SIxtly, I conceive, nothing taketh beginning from it ſelf, but from the action of ſome other immediate Agent without it ſelf. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when firſt a man had an appetite or will, to ſomething, to which immediately before he had no appetite nor will, the cauſe of his will is not the will it ſelf, but ſomething els, not in his own diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. So that where as it is out of controverſy that of voluntary actions the will is a neceſſary cauſe; And by this which is ſaid the will is alſo cauſed by other things whereof it diſpoſeth not, it followeth that voluntary actions have all of them neceſſary cauſes, and therefore are neceſſitated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THis ſixt point doth not conſiſt in explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of tearmes, as the former, but in two proofs, that voluntary actions are neceſſitated. The former proof ſtands thus, <hi>Nothing takes beginning from it ſelf, but from ſome Agent without it ſelf, which is not in its own diſpoſing, therefore &amp;c. concedo omnia,</hi> I grant all he ſaith, The will doth not take beginning from it ſelf. Whether he underſtand by <hi>will</hi> the faculty of the will, which is a power of the reaſonable ſoul, it takes not beginning from it ſelf, but from God, who created and infuſed the Soul into man, and endowed it with this power: Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he underſtand by <hi>will,</hi> the act of willing, it takes not beginning from it ſelf, but from the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169972:112"/> faculty, or from the power of willing, which is in the Soul. This is certain, finite and participated things cannot be from themſelves, nor be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by themſelves. What would he conclude from hence? that therefore the act of willing takes not its beginning from the faculty of the will? Or that the faculty is alwayes determined antecedently, extrinſecally to will that which it doth will? He may as ſoon draw water out of a pumice, as draw any ſuch concluſion out of theſe premiſſes. Secondly, for his <hi>taking a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> Either he underſtands <hi>a beginning of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or a <hi>beginning of working and acting,</hi> If he underſtand a beginning of being, he ſaith moſt truly, that nothing hath a beginning of being in time from it ſelf, But this is nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The queſtion is not between us whether the Soul of man, or the will of man be eternall, But if he underſtand <hi>a beginning of working or mooving actually,</hi> it is a groſs errour. All men know that when a ſtone deſcends, or fire aſcends, or when water, that hath been heated returnes, to its former temper, the beginning or reaſon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall, and one and the ſame thing doth moove and is mooved in a diverſe reſpect. It mooves in reſpect of the form, and it is mooved in reſpect of the matter. Much more man, who hath a perfect knowledge and prenotion of the end, is moſt properly ſaid to moove himſelf. Yet <hi>I</hi> do not deny but that there are other beginnings of humane actions, which do concur with the will, ſome outward as the firſt cauſe by generall influence, which is evermore requiſite, Angells
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169972:112"/> or men by perſwading, evill ſpirits by tempting, the object or end by its appetibility, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by directing. So paſſions and acquired habits. But I deny that any of theſe do neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or can neceſſitate the will of man by deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining it Phyſically to one, except God alone, who doth it rarely in extraordinary caſes. And where there is no antecedent determination to one, there is no abſolute neceſſity but true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>His ſecond argument is <hi>ex conceſſis, It is out of controverſy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that of voluntary actions the will is a neceſſary cauſe.</hi> The argument may be thus reduced. Neceſſary cauſes produce neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary effects, but the Will is a neceſſarie cauſe of voluntary actions. I might deny his major; Neceſſary cauſes do not alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce neceſſary effects, except they be alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily produced, as I have ſhewed before the burning of <hi>Protagoras</hi> his book. But I anſwer cleerly to the minor, that the will is not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſe of what it wills in particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is without <hi>controverſy</hi> indeed, for it is without all probability. That it wills, when it wills, is neceſſary, but that it wills this or that, now or then, is free. More expreſly the act of the will may be conſidered three wayes; Either in reſpect of its nature, or in reſpect of its exerciſe, or in reſpect of its object. Firſt, for the nature of the act; That which the will wills is neceſſarily voluntary, becauſe the will cannot be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And in this ſenſe, <hi>it is out of controverſy, that the will is a neceſſary cauſe of voluntary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:169972:113"/> Secondly, for the exerciſe of its acts, that is not neceſſary. The will may either will or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend its act. Thirdly, for the object that is not neceſſary but free, the will is not extrinſecally determined to its objects. As for example, The Cardinalls meet in the conclave to choſe a Pope, whom they choſe he is neceſſarily Pope. But it is not neceſſary that they ſhall choſe this or that day. Before they were aſſembled they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their aſſembling, when they are aſſembled, they may ſuſpend their election for a day or a week. Laſtly, for the perſon whom they will chooſe, it is freely in their own power, otherwiſe if the election were not free, it were void, and no election at all. So that which takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the will, is neceſſarily voluntary, but it is not neceſſary that the will ſhall will this or that in particular, as it was neceſſary, that the perſon freely elected ſhould be Pope, but it was not neceſſary, either that the election ſhould be at this time, or that this man ſhould be elected. And therefore voluntary acts in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, have not neceſſary cauſes, that is, they are not neceſſitated.</p>

                  <hi>SEventhly, I hold that to be a ſufficient cauſe to which nothing is wanting that is needfull to the producing of the effect. The ſame is alſo a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſe, for if it be poſſible, that a ſufficient cauſe ſhall not bring forth the effect, then there wanted ſomewhat which was needfull to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it, and ſo the cauſe was not ſufficient. But if it be impoſſible that a ſufficient cauſe ſhould
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169972:113"/> not produce the effect, then is a ſufficient cauſe a neceſſary cauſe, (for that is ſaid to produce an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect neceſſarily, that cannot but produce it) Hence it is manifeſt, that whatſoever is produced, is produced neceſſarily, for whatſoever is produced hath had a ſufficient cauſe to produce it, or els it had not been. And therefore alſo voluntary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are neceſſitated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>J. D.</label> THis ſection containes a third Argument to proove that all effects are neceſſary, for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof it is needfull to conſider how a cauſe may be ſaid to be ſufficient or inſufficient.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, ſeverall cauſes ſingly conſidered may be inſufficient, and the ſame taken conjointly be ſufficient to produce an effect. As two horſes jointly are ſufficient to draw a Coach, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſingly is inſufficient to do. Now to make the effect, that is the drawing of the Coach neceſſary, it is not onely required, that the two horſes be ſufficient to draw it, but alſo that their conjunction be neceſſary, and their habitude ſuch as they may draw it. If the owner of one of theſe horſes will not ſuffer him to draw, If the Smith have ſhod the other in the quick, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him; If the horſe have caſt a ſhoe, or be a reſty jade, and will not draw but when he liſt, then the effect is not neceſſarily produced, but contingently more or leſs, as the concurrence of the cauſes is more or leſs contingent.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, a cauſe may be ſaid to be ſufficient, either becauſe it produceth that effect which is intended, as in the generation of a man, or els,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169972:114"/> becauſe it is ſufficient to produce that which is produced, as in the generation of a Monſter. The former is properly called a ſufficient cauſe, the later a weak and inſufficient cauſe. Now, if the debility of the cauſe be not neceſſary, but contingent, then the effect is not neceſſary, but contingent. It is a rule in Logick, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion alwayes followes the weaker part. If the premiſes be but probable, the concluſion cannot be demonſtrative. It holds as well in cauſes as in propoſitions. No effect can exceed the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its cauſe. If the ability or debility, of the cauſes be contingent, the effect cannot be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, that which concernes this queſtion of Liberty from neceſſity moſt neerely is. That a cauſe is ſaid to be ſufficient in reſpect of the ability of it to act, not in reſpect of its will to act. The concurrence of the will is needfull to the production of a free effect. But the cauſe may be ſufficient, though the will do not concur. As God is ſufficient to produce a thouſand worlds, but it doth not follow from thence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he hath produced them, or that he will produce them. The blood of Chriſt is a ſufficient ranſome for all mankind, but it doth not follow therefore, that all mankind ſhall be actually ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by vertue of his Blood. A man may be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Tutour, though he will not teach every Scholler, and a ſufficient Phyſitian, though he will not adminiſter to every patient. Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much therefore as the concurrence of the will is needfull to the production of every free effect,

                  <label>J. D.</label> THis laſt point is but a Corollary, or an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the former doctrine, that <hi>every ſufficient cauſe produceth its effect neceſſarily,</hi> which pillar being taken away the ſuperſtructure muſt needs fall to the ground, having nothing left to ſupport it. <hi>Laſtly, I hold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what he is able to proove is ſomething.</hi> So much reaſon, ſo much truſt, but what he <hi>holds</hi> concernes himſelf not others. But what holds he? <hi>I hold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the ordinary definition of a free Agent implies a contradiction, and is non-ſenſe.</hi> That which he calls the <hi>ordinary definition</hi> of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the very definition which is given by the much greater part of Philoſophers &amp; School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And doth he think that all theſe ſpake non-ſenſe? or had no more judgment than to contradict themſelves in a definition? He might much better ſuſpect himſelf, than cenſure ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Let us ſee the definition it ſelf: <hi>A free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is that, which when all things are preſent, that are needfull to produce the effect, can never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs not produce it.</hi> I acknowledge the old definition of Liberty, with little variation. But I cannot ſee this <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> nor diſcover this <hi>contradiction.</hi> For in theſe words <hi>all things needfull,</hi> or <hi>all things requiſite,</hi> the actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the will is not included. But by <hi>all things needfull or requiſite.</hi> All neceſſary power either operative or elective, all neceſſarie inſtruments and adjuments extrinſecall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall, and all conditions are intended. As he that hath pen and ink, and paper, a table, a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169972:115"/> desk, and leiſure, the art of writing, and the free uſe of his hand, hath all things requiſite to write if he will, and yet he may forbear, if he will. Or as he that hath men and mony, and armes, and munition, and ſhipps, and a juſt cauſe, hath all things requiſite for war, yet he may make peace, if he will. Or as the King proclaimed in the Goſpell, Matth. 22.4. <hi>I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fatlings are killed, all things are ready, come unto the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> According to <hi>T. H.</hi> his doctrine, the gueſts might have told him, that he ſaid not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for their own wills were not ready. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the will were (as he conceives it is) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated extrinſecally to every act of willing, if it had no power to forbear willing what it doth will, nor to will what it doth not will, then if the will were wanting, ſomething requiſite to the producing of the effect was wanting. But now when Science and conſcience, reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, our own and other mens experience doth teach us, that the will hath a dominion over its own acts to will, or nill without extrinſecall neceſſitation. If the power to will be preſent <hi>in actu primo,</hi> determinable by our ſelves, then there is no neceſſary power wanting in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the producing of the effect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe words <hi>to act or not to act, to work or not to work, to produce or not to produce,</hi> have reference to the effect, not as a thing which is already done, or doing, but as a thing to be done. They imply not the actuall production but the producibility of the effect. But when
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169972:116"/> once the will hath actually concurred with all other cauſes and conditions, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, then the effect is no more poſſible, or producible, but it is in being, and actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Thus he takes away the ſubject of the queſtion. The queſtion is whether effects producible be free from neceſſity. He ſhuffles out <hi>effects producible,</hi> and thruſts in their places <hi>effects produced,</hi> or which are in the act of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</hi> Wherefore I conclude, that it is neither <hi>non-ſenſe</hi> nor <hi>contradiction</hi> to ſay, that a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, when all things requiſite to produce the effect are preſent, may nevertheleſs not produce it.</p>

                  <hi>FOr my firſt five points where it is explicated, Firſt, what Spontaneity is, Secondly, what Deliberation is, Thirdly, what Will, Propenſion and Appetite is, Fourthly, what a free Agent is, Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what Liberty is, There can be no other proof offered, but every mans own experience, by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on himſelf, and remembring what he uſeth to have in his mind, that is what he himſelf meaneth, when he ſaith, an action is ſpontaneous, A man deliberates, ſuch is his will, That Agent, or that action is free. Now, he that ſo reflecteth on himſelf cannot but be ſatisfied, but that <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration</hi> is the conſidering of the good &amp; evill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quells of the action to come, That by <hi>Spontaneity,</hi> is meant inconſiderate proceeding, (for els nothing is meant by it.) That <hi>will</hi> is the laſt act of our Deliberation. That a <hi>free Agent,</hi> is he that can do, if he will, and forbear, if he will. And that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:169972:116"/> is the abſence of exteruall impediments; But to thoſe that out of cuſtome ſpeak not what they conceive, but what they hear, and are not able, or will not take the pains to conſider what they think, when they hear ſuch words, no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be ſufficient, becauſe experience, and matter of fact is not verified by other mens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but by every mans own ſenſe, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. For example, how can it be prooved, that to love a thing, and to think it good are all one, to a man that does not mark his own meaning by thoſe words. Or how can it be prooued that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not <hi>nunc Stans,</hi> to a man that ſayes theſe words by cuſtome, and never conſiders how he can conceive the thing it ſelf in his mind. Alſo the ſixt point, that a man cannot imagine any thing to begin without a cauſe, can no other way be made known but by trying how he can imagine it. But if he try, he ſhall find as much reaſon (if there be no cauſe of the thing) to conceive, it ſhould begin at one time as another, that is, he hath equall reaſon to think, it ſhould begin at all times, which is impoſſible. And therefore he muſt think there was ſome ſpeciall cauſe, why it began then rather than ſooner or later, or els, that it began never, but was Eternall.</hi>

                  <label>J. D.</label> NOw at length he comes to his main proofs; He that hath ſo confidently cenſured the whole current of School-men and Philoſophers of <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> had need to produce ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for himſelf. So he calls his reaſons, Numb. 36. <hi>demonſtrative proofs.</hi> All demonſtrations are either from the cauſe or the effect, not from
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169972:117"/> private notions and conceptions, which we have in our minds. That which he calls a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſerves not the name of an intimation. He argues thus; <hi>That which a man conceives in his mind, by theſe words Spontaneity, Deliberation, &amp;c. that they are.</hi> This is his propoſition which I deny. The true natures of things are not to be judged by the private <hi>ideas,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of men, but by their cauſes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall reaſons. Ask an ordinary perſon what <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ſignifies, and whether our Antipodes have their heads upwards or downwards; And he will not ſtick to tell you, that if his head be upwards, theirs muſt needs be downwards. And this is becauſe he knowes not the formall reaſon thereof. That the Heavens incircle the earth, and what is towards heaven is upwards. This ſame erronious notion of <hi>vpwards</hi> and <hi>downwards</hi> before the true reaſon was fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, abuſed more than ordinary capacities, as appeares by their arguments of <hi>pend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>li homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and <hi>pendulae arbores.</hi> Again, what do men conceive ordinary by this word <hi>empty,</hi> as when they ſay an empty veſſell, or by this word <hi>Body,</hi> as when they ſay, there is no body in that roome, they intend not to exclude the aire, either out of the veſſell, or out of the roome. Yet reaſon tells us, that the veſſell is not truly empty, and that the aire is a true body. I might give an hundred ſuch like inſtances. He, who leaves the conduct of his underſtanding to follow vulgar notions, ſhall plunge himſelf into a thouſand er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, like him who leaves a certaine guide to follow an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> or a Will, with the wiſpe.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169972:117"/> So his propoſition is falſe. His reaſon, <hi>That mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact is not verified by other mens Arguments, but by every mans own ſenſe and memory,</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe maimed on both ſides, whether we hear ſuch words, or not, is matter of fact, and ſenſe is the proper judge of it. But what theſe words do, or ought truely to ſignifie, is not to be judged by ſenſe but by reaſon. Secondly, reaſon may, and doth oftentimes correct ſenſe, even about its proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Senſe tells us that the Sun is no bigger than a good Ball, but reaſon demonſtrates, that it is many times greater than the whole Globe of the earth. As to his inſtance, <hi>How can it be proved, that to love a thing, and to think it good, is all one to a man that doth not make his own meaning by theſe words,</hi> I confeſs, it cannot be proved, for it is not true. Beauty and likeneſs, and love, do conciliate love as much as goodneſs, <hi>cos amoris amor. Love</hi> is a paſſion of the will, but to judge of goodneſs, is an act of the underſtanding. A Father may love an ungracious Childe, and yet not eſteem him good. A man loves his own houſe better than another mans, yet he cannot but eſteem many others better than his own. His other inſtance, <hi>How can it be proved that eternity is not</hi> nunc ſtans, <hi>to a man that ſayes theſe words by cuſtom, and never conſiders how he can conceive the thing it ſelf in his minde,</hi> is juſt like the former, not to be proved by reaſon, but by fancie, which is the way he takes. And it is not unlike the counſel, which one gave to a <hi>Novice</hi> about the choiſe of his wiſe, to advice with the Bels, as he fancied ſo they founded, either take her, or leave her.</p>
               <p>Then for his aſſumption it is as defective as his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169972:118"/> propoſition, That <hi>by theſe words ſpontaneity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>men do underſtand as he conceives.</hi> No rational man doth conceive a <hi>ſpontaneous</hi> action, and an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberate</hi> action to be all one, every <hi>indeliberate</hi> action is not <hi>ſpontaneous.</hi> The fire conſiders not whether it ſhould burn, yet the burning of it is not <hi>ſpontaneous.</hi> Neither is every <hi>ſpontaneous</hi> action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberate, a man may deliberate what he will eat, and yet eat it <hi>ſpontaneouſly.</hi> Neither doth <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> properly ſignifie the <hi>conſidering of the good and evil ſequels of an action to come:</hi> But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether this be a good and fit means, or the beſt, and fitteſt means for obtaining ſuch an end. The Phyſician doth not deliberate whether he ſhould cure his Patient, but by what means he ſhould cure him. Deliberation is of the means not of the end. Much leſs doth any man conceive with <hi>T. H.</hi> that deliberation is an <hi>imagination,</hi> or an act of fancy, not of reaſon, common to men of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with mad men, and natural fools and children, and bruit beaſts. Thirdly, neither doth any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man conceive, or can conceive, either that the <hi>will is an act of our deliberation,</hi> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the will are two diſtinct faculties, or that <hi>onely the laſt appetite is to be called our will.</hi> So no man ſhould be able to ſay this is my will, becauſe he knows not whether he ſhall perſevere in it, or not. Concerning the fourth point we agree that <hi>he is a free Agent that can do, if he will, and forbear if he will.</hi> But I wonder how this dropped from his pen, what is now become of his abſolute neceſſity of all things? If a man be free to do and to forbear any thing, will he make himſelf guilty of the <hi>non-ſence</hi> of the School-men; and run with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169972:118"/> them into contradictions for company? It may be he will ſay he can do if he will, and forbear if he will, but he cannot will if he will. This will not ſerve his turn, for if the cauſe of a free action, that is, the will to be determined, then the effect, or the action it ſelf is likewiſe determined, a determined cauſe cannot produce an undetermined effect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Agent can will, and forbear to will, or elſe he cannot do, and forbear to do. But we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer wholy about the fifth point. He who conceives <hi>liberty</hi> aright, conceives both a <hi>liberty in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to will, or not to will, and a <hi>liberty to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to will this, or that, and a <hi>liberty from impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</hi> T. H. by a new way of his own cuts off the <hi>liberty of the ſubject,</hi> as if a ſtone was free to aſcend, or deſcend, becauſe it hath no outward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. And the <hi>liberty towards the object,</hi> as if the Needle touched with the Load-ſtone were free to point, either towards the North, or towards the South, becauſe there is not a Barrecado in its way to hinder it, yea, he cuts off the <hi>liberty from inward impediments</hi> alſo: As if an Hawk were at liberty to fly when her wings are plucked, but not when they are tied. And ſo he makes <hi>liberty from extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal impediments</hi> to be compleat liberty, ſo he aſcribes <hi>liberty</hi> to bruit beaſts, and <hi>liberty</hi> to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and by conſequence makes Beaſts and Rivers to be capeable of ſin and puniſhment. Aſſuredly, <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who cauſed the Helleſpont to be beaten with ſo many ſtripes, was of this opinion. Laſtly, <hi>T. H.</hi> his reaſon, that <hi>it is custom, or want of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or negligence which makes a man conceive otherwiſe,</hi> is but a begging of that which he ſhould prove. Other men conſider as ſeriouſly as himſelf,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169972:119"/> with as much judgement as himſelf, with leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice than himſelf, and yet they can apprehend no ſuch ſenſe of theſe words, would he have other men feign that they ſee fiery Dragons in the Air, becauſe he affirms confidently that he ſees them, and wonders why others are ſo blinde as not to ſee them?</p>
               <p>The reaſon for the ſixth point is like the former, a phantaſtical, or imaginative reaſon. <hi>How can a man imagine any thing to begin without a cauſe, or if it ſhould begin without a cauſe, why it ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at this time rather than at that time?</hi> He ſaith truely, nothing can <hi>begin</hi> without a cauſe, that is <hi>to be,</hi> but it may <hi>begin to act</hi> of it ſelf without any other cauſe. Nothing can begin without a cauſe, but many things may begin, and do begin without neceſſary cauſes. A free cauſe may as wel chooſe his time when he will begin, as a neceſſary cauſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined extrinſically when it muſt begin. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though free effects cannot be foretold, becauſe they are not certainly predetermined in their cauſes, yet when the free cauſes do determine themſelves, they are of as great certainty as the other. As when I ſee a Bell ringing, I can conceive the cauſe of it as well why it rings now, as I know the interpoſition of the earth to be the cauſe of the Eclipſe of the Moon. Or the moſt certain occurrent in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things.</p>
               <p>And now that I have anſwered <hi>T. H.</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the private conceptions of men concerning the ſenſe of words, I deſire him ſeriouſly without prejudice to examine himſelf and thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notions, which he findes in himſelf, not of words, but of things, theſe are from nature, thoſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169972:119"/> are by impoſition, whether he doth not finde by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that he doth many things, which he might have left undone if he would, and omits many things which he might have done if he would, whether he doth not ſomethings out of meer ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, and will without either regard to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of right reaſon, or ſerious reſpect of what is honeſt, or profitable, onely to ſhew that he will have a dominion over his own actions, as we ſee ordinarily in Children, and wiſe men finde at ſome times in themſelves by experience. And I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this very defence of neceſſity againſt liberty to be partly of that kinde. Whether he is not angry with thoſe who draw him from his ſtudy, or croſs him in his deſires, if they be neceſſitated to do it, why ſhould he be angry with them, any more than he is angry with a ſharp winter, or a rainy day that keeps him at home againſt his antecedent will, whether he doth not ſometime blame himſelf, and ſay, <hi>O what a fool was I to do thus and thus,</hi> or wiſh to himſelf, <hi>O that I had been wiſe,</hi> or, <hi>O that</hi> I <hi>had not done ſuch an act.</hi> If he have no dominion over his actions, if he be irreſiſtibly neceſſitated to all things what he doth, he might as well wiſh, <hi>O that</hi> I <hi>had not breathed,</hi> or blame himſelf for growing old, <hi>O what a fool was</hi> I <hi>to grow old.</hi>

                  <hi>FOr the ſeventh point, that all events have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes, it is there proved in that they have ſufficient cauſes. Further, Let us in this place alſo ſuppoſe any event never ſo caſuall, as for example, the throwing Ambs-ace upon a paire of Dice, and ſee if it muſt not have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169972:120"/> before it was thrown, for, ſeeing it was thrown, it had a beginning, and conſequently a ſufficient cauſe to produce it, conſiſting partly in the Dice, partly in the outward things, as the poſture of the parties hand, the meaſure of force applied by the caſter, The poſture of the parts of the Table, and the like; In ſumme, there was nothing wanting that was neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the producing of that particular caſt, and conſequently, that caſt was neceſſarily thrown. For if it had not been thrown, there had wanted ſomewhat requiſite to the throwing of it, and ſo the cauſe had not been ſufficient. In the like manner it may be proved that every other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, how contingent ſoever it ſeeme, or how vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſoever it be, is produced neceſſarily, which is that <hi>J. D.</hi> diſputes againſt. The ſame alſo may be proved in this manner, Let the caſe be put, for example of the weather, <hi>Tis neceſſary that to morrow it ſhall rain, or not rain.</hi> If therefore it be not neceſſary, it ſhall rain, it is neceſſary it ſhall not rain. Otherwiſe it is not neceſſary that the propoſition. <hi>It ſhall rain, or it ſhall not rain,</hi> ſhould be true. I know there are ſome that ſay, it may neceſſarily be true, that one of the two ſhall come to paſs, but not ſingly that it ſhall rain, or it ſhall not rain. Which is as much as to ſay. One of them is neceſſary, yet neither of them is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; And therefore to ſeeme to avoid, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity they make a diſtinction, that neither of them is true <hi>determinatè</hi> but <hi>indeterminatè</hi> Which diſtinction, either ſignifies no more than this, One of them is true, but we know not which,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169972:120"/> and ſo the neceſſity remains, though we know it not: Or if the meaning of the diſtinction be not that, it has no meaning. And they might as well have ſaid, One of them is true, <hi>Tytyrice</hi> but neither of them <hi>Tupatulice.</hi>

And his two inſtances of caſting Ambs-ace, &amp; rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to morrow, are altogether impertinent to the queſtion now agitated between us, for two reaſons. Firſt, our preſent controverſie is concerning free actions, which proceed from the liberty of mans will, both his inſtances are of contingent actions, which proceed from the indetermination, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent concurrence of natural cauſes. Firſt, that there are free actions, which proceed meerly from election, without any outward neceſſitation is a truth ſo evident, as that there is a Sun in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and he that doubteth of it may as well doubt whether there be a ſhell without the Nut, or a ſtone within the Olive. A man proportions his time each day, and allots ſo much to his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo much to his Study, ſo much to his Diet, ſo much to his Recreations, ſo much to neceſſary, or civil viſits, ſo much to his reſt, he who will ſeek for I know not what cauſes of all this without himſelf, except that good God who hath given him a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul, may as well ſeek for a cauſe of the Egyptian <hi>Pyramides</hi> among the Crocodiles of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> Secondly, for mixt actions which proceed from the concurrence of free and natural Agents, though they be not free, yet they are not neceſſary, as to keep my former inſtance, a man walking through
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169972:121"/> a ſtreet of a Citie to do his occaſions, a Tile falls from an Houſe and breaks his head, the breaking of his head was not neceſſary, for he did freely chooſe to go that way without any neceſſitation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it free, for he did not deliberate of that accident, therefore it was contingent, and by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted conſequence there are contingent actions in the World which are not free. Moſt certainly by the concurrence of free cauſes, as God, the good and bad Angels and men, with natural Agents ſometimes on purpoſe, and ſometimes by accident many events happen, which otherwiſe had never hapned; many effects are produced which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had never been produced. And admitting ſuch things to be contingent not neceſſary, all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent effects, not onely immediate, but mediate muſt likewiſe be contingent, that is to ſay, ſuch as do not proceed from a continued connexion and ſucceſſion of neceſſary cauſes, which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>T. H.</hi> his opinion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the actions of bruit beaſts, though they be not free, though they have not the uſe of reaſon to reſtrain their appetites from that which is ſenſitively good by the conſideration of what is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaly good, or what is honeſt, and though their fancies be determined by nature to ſome kindes of work, yet to think that every individual action of theirs, and each animal motion of theirs, even to the leaſt murmure, or geſture is bound by the chain of unalterable neceſſity to the extrinſecal cauſes or objects, I ſee no ground for it. Chriſt ſaith <hi>one of theſe Sparrows doth not fall to the ground without your Heavenly Father,</hi> that is without an influence of power from him, or exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his diſpoſition,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169972:121"/> he doth not ſay which your heavenly Father caſteth not down. Laſtly, for the natural actions of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Creatures, wherein there is not the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of any free, or voluntary Agents, the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is yet more doubtfull, for many things are called co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent in reſpect of us, becauſe we know not the cauſe of them, which really &amp; in themſelves are not contingent, but neceſſary. Alſo many things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent in reſpect of one ſingle cauſe, either actually hindred, or in poſſibility to be hindred, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in reſpect of the joynt concurrence of all col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral cauſes. But whether there be a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of all natural cauſes from the beginning, ſo as they muſt all have concurred as they have done, &amp; in the ſame degree of power, &amp; have been defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as they have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all events whatſoever, would require a further examination if it were pertinent to this queſtion of liberty; but it is not. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to my purpoſe to have ſhewed that all elective actions are free from abſolute neceſſity. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the concurrence of voluntary and free Agents with natural cauſes, both upon purpoſe and accidentally hath helped them to produce many effects, which otherwiſe they had not produced, and hindred them from producing many effects, which otherwiſe they had produced. And that if this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intervention of voluntary and free Agents had been more frequent than it hath been, (as without doubt it might have been) many natural events had been otherwiſe than they are. And therefore he might have ſpared his inſtances of caſting <hi>Ambs-ace</hi> and raining to morrow. And firſt for his caſting <hi>Ambs-ace.</hi> If it be thrown by a fair Gameſter with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Dice, it is a mixt action, the caſting of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169972:122"/> Dice is free, but the caſting of <hi>Ambs-ace</hi> is contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, a man may deliberate whether he will caſt the Dice, or not, but it were folly to deliberate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will caſt <hi>Ambs-ace,</hi> or not, becauſe it is not in his power, unleſs he be a cheater that can cogge the Dice, or the Dice be falſe Dice, &amp; then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency, or the degree of contingency ceaſeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as the Caſter hath more, or leſs cunning, or as the figure, or making of the Dice doth incline them to <hi>Ambs-ace</hi> more than to another caſt, or neceſſitate them to this caſt and no other. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſo far as the caſt is free, or contingent, ſo far it is not neceſſary. And where neceſſity begins, there liberty and contingency do ceaſe to be: Likewiſe his other inſtance of raining, or not raining, to morrow is not of a free elective act, nor alwayes of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent act. In ſome Countries as they have their <hi>nati venti</hi> their certain winds at ſet ſeaſons, ſo they have their certain and ſet rains. The <hi>Aethiopian</hi> rains are ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of the certain inundation of <hi>Nilus.</hi> In ſome eaſtern Countries they have rain onely twice a year, and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which the Scriptures call <hi>the former and the later rain.</hi> In ſuch places not onely the cauſes do act determinately and neceſſarily, but alſo the determination, or neceſſity of the event is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the inhabitants. In our Climate the natural cauſes coeleſtial and ſublunary do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce rain ſo neceſſarily at ſet times, neither can we ſay ſo certainly and infallibly, it will rain to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or it will not rain to morrow. Nevertheleſſe, it may ſo happen that the cauſes are ſo diſpoſed and determined, even in our climate, that this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will rain to morrow, or it will not rain, to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169972:122"/> morrow may be neceſſary in it ſelf, and the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, or tokens may be ſuch in the sky, in our own bodies, in the creatures, animate and inanimate as weather-glaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it may become probably true to us that it will rain to morrow, or it will not rain to morrow. But ordinarily it is a contingent propoſition to us, whether it be contingent alſo in it ſelf, that is, whether the concurrence of the cauſes were abſolutely neceſſary, whether the vapours, or matter of the rain may not yet be diſperſed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe conſumed, or driven beyond our coaſt, is a ſpeculation which no way concerns this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So we ſee one reaſon why his two inſtances are altogether impertinent, becauſe they are of actions which are not free, nor elective, nor ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the liberty of mans will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our diſpute is about abſolute neceſſity, his proofs extend onely to Hypothetical neceſſity. Our queſtion is, whether the concurrence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the cauſes were neceſſary before they did concur, or were determined. He proves that the effect is neceſſary after the cauſes have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, and are determined. The freeſt actions of God, or man, are neceſſary by ſuch a neceſſity of ſuppoſition. And the moſt contingent events that are, as I have ſhewed plainly, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. where his inſtance of <hi>Ambs-ace</hi> is more fully anſwered. So his proof looks another way from his propoſition. His propoſition is, that <hi>the caſting of</hi> Ambs-ace <hi>was neceſſary before it was thrown.</hi> His proof is that it was neceſſary <hi>when it was thrown,</hi> examine all his cauſes over and over, and they will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him one grain of antecedent neceſſity. The firſt cauſe is in the <hi>Dice:</hi> True, if they be falſe Dice
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169972:123"/> there may be ſomething in it, but then his contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency is deſtroyed. If they be ſquare Dice, they have no more inclination to <hi>Ambs-ace,</hi> than to Cinque and Quater, or any other caſt. His ſecond cauſe is <hi>the poſture of the parties hand:</hi> But what neceſſity was there that he ſhould put his hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a poſture. None at all. The third cauſe is <hi>the meaſure of the force applied by the caſter.</hi> Now for the credit of his cauſe let him but name, I will not ſay a convincing reaſon, nor ſo much as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon, but even any pretence of reaſon, how the Caſter was neceſſitated from without himſelf to apply juſt ſo much force, and neither more or leſſe. If he cannot, his cauſe is deſperate, and he may hold his peace for ever, his laſt cauſe is <hi>the poſture of the Table.</hi> But tell us in good earneſt what neceſſity there was why the Caſter muſt throw into that Table rather than the other, or that the Dice muſt fall juſt upon that part of the Table, <hi>before the caſt was thrown:</hi> He that makes theſe to be neceſſary cauſes, I do not wonder if he make all effects neceſſary effects. If any one of theſe <hi>cauſes</hi> be contingent, it is ſufficient to render the caſt contingent, and now that they are all ſo contingent, yet he will needs have the effect to be neceſſary. And ſo it is when the caſt is thrown, but not before the caſt was thrown, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to prove: who can blame him for being ſo angry with the School-men, and their diſtinctions of neceſſity into abſolute and hypothetical, ſeeing they touch his freehold ſo nearly.</p>
               <p>But though his inſtance of raining to morrow be impertinent, as being no free action, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he triumphs ſo much in his argument, I will
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169972:123"/> not ſtick to go a little out of my way to meet a friend. For I confeſs, the validity of the reaſon had been the ſame, if he had made it of a free action, as thus: Either I ſhall finiſh this reply to morrow, or I ſhall not finiſh this reply to morrow, is a neceſſary propoſition. But becauſe he ſhall not complain of any diſadvantage in the alteration of his terms; I will for once adventure upon his ſhower of rain. And firſt, I readily admit his major that this propoſition (either it will rain to morrow, or it will not rain to morrow, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily true, for of two contradictory propoſitions, the one muſt of neceſſity be true, becauſe no third can be given. But his minor that <hi>it could not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily true, except one of the Members were neceſſarily true,</hi> is moſt falſe. And ſo is his proof likewiſe. That <hi>if neither the one nor the other of the Members be neceſſarily true, it cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that either the one, or the other is true.</hi> A conjunct propoſition may have both parts falſe, and yet the propoſition be true, as if the Sun ſhine, it is day, is a true propoſition at midnight. And <hi>T. H.</hi> confeſſeth as much, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. <hi>If I ſhall live I ſhall eat, is a neceſſary propoſition, that is to ſay, it is neceſſary that that propoſition ſhould be true whenſoever uttered. But it is not the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the thing, nor is it therefore neceſſary that the man ſhall live, or that the man ſhall eat.</hi> And ſo <hi>T. H.</hi> proceeds, <hi>I do not uſe to fortifie my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions with ſuch reaſons.</hi> But it ſeemeth he hath forgotten himſelf, and is contented with ſuch poor fortifications. And though both parts of a disjunctive propoſition cannot be falſe, becauſe if it be a right disjunction, the Members are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169972:124"/> whereof one part is infallibly true, yet vary put the propoſition a little to abate the edge of the disjunctions, and you ſhall finde that which <hi>T. H.</hi> ſaith to be true, that <hi>it is not the neceſſity of the thing</hi> which makes the propoſition to be true. As for example vary it thus: <hi>I know that either it will rain to morrow, or that it will not rain to morrow</hi> is a true propoſition: But it is not true that I know it will rain to morrow, neither is it true that I know it will not rain to morrow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the certain truth of the propoſition doth not prove, that either of the Members is determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true in preſent. Truth is a conformity of the underſtanding to the thing known, whereof ſpeech is an interpreter. If the underſtanding agree not with the thing it is an errour, if the words agree not with the underſtanding it is a lie. Now the thing known is known either in it ſelf, or in its cauſes. If it be known in it ſelf, as it is, then we expreſſe our apprehenſion of it in words of the preſent tence, as <hi>the Sun is riſen.</hi> If it be known in its cauſe, we expreſſe our ſelves in words of the future tenſe, as <hi>to morrow will be an Eclipſe of the Moon.</hi> But if we neither know it in its ſelf, nor in its cauſes, then there may be a foundation of truth, but there is no ſuch determinate truth of it, that we can reduce it into a true propoſition, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay it doth rain to morrow, or it doth not rain to morrow. That were not onely falſe but abſurd, we cannot poſitively ſay it will rain to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, becauſe we do not know it in its cauſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how they are determined, or that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, wherefore the certitude and evidence of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169972:124"/> the disjunctive propoſition is neither founded upon that which will be actually to morrow, for it is granted that we do not know that. Nor yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the determination of the cauſes, for then we would not ſay indifferently, either it will rain, or it will not rain, but poſitively it will rain, or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively it will not rain. But it is grounded upon an undeniable principle, that of two contradictory propoſitions, the one muſt neceſſarily be true. And therefore to ſay, either this, or that will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be, but it is not yet determined whether this, or that ſhall be, is no ſuch ſenſeleſſe aſſertion that it deſerved a <hi>Tytyrice Tupatulice,</hi> but an evident truth which no man that hath his eyes in his head can doubt of.</p>
               <p>If all this will not ſatisfie him, I will give one of his own kinde of proofs, that is an inſtance. That which neceſſitates all things according to <hi>T. H.</hi> is the decree of God, or that order which is ſet to all things by the eternal cauſe (<hi>Numb.</hi> 11.) Now God himſelf, who made this neceſſitating decree, was not ſubjected to it in the making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither was there any former order to oblige the firſt cauſe neceſſarily to make ſuch a decree, therefore this decree being an act <hi>ad extra</hi> was freely made by God without any neceſſitation. Yet nevertheleſs, this disjunctive propoſition is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily true. <hi>Either God did make ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or he did not make ſuch a decree.</hi> Again, though <hi>T. H.</hi> his opinion were true that all events are neceſſary, and that the whole Chriſtian world are deceived, who believe that ſome events are free from neceſſity, yet he will not deny, but if it had been the good pleaſure of God, he might
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169972:125"/> have made ſome cauſes free from neceſſity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it neither argues any imperfection, nor implies any contradiction. Suppoſing therefore that God had made ſome ſecond cauſes free from any ſuch antecedent determination to one, yet the former disjunction would be neceſſarily true. Either this free undetermined cauſe will act after this manner, or it will not act after this manner. Wherefore the neceſſary truth of ſuch a disjunctive propoſition doth not prove, that either of the members of the disjunction ſingly conſidered, is determinately true in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but onely that the one of them will be determinately true to morrow.</p>

But I will deal more favourably with him, and grant him all that, which he labours ſo much in vain to prove, That every effect in the world hath ſufficient cauſes: Yea more, that ſuppoſing the determination of the free and contingent cauſes, every effect in the world is neceſſary. But all this will not advantage his cauſe the black of a bean, for ſtill it amounts but to an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall neceſſity, and differs as much from that abſolute neceſſity, which he maintains, as a Gentleman, who travailes for his pleaſure, differs from a baniſhed man, or a free Subject from a ſlave.</p>

There is no impediment in Logick, why a man may not preſs his Adverſary with thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities which flow from his opinion, <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ducens ad impoſſibile,</hi> or, <hi>ad abſurdum,</hi> is a good form of reaſoning. But there is another reaſon of his forbearance, though he be loth to expreſs it. —<hi>Haeret lateri laethalis arundo.</hi> The Arguments drawn from the attributes of God do ſtick ſo cloſe in the ſides of his cauſe, that he hath no mind to treate of that ſubject. By the way take notice of his own confeſſion, that <hi>he could add other reaſons, if he thought it good Logick.</hi> If it were predetermined in the outward cauſes, that he muſt make this very defence and no other, how could it be in his power to add or ſubſtract any thing. Juſt as if a blind-man ſhould ſay in earneſt, I could ſee, if I had mine eyes: Truth often breaks out, whileſt men ſeek to ſmother it. But let us view his Argument: If a man have liberty from neceſſitation, he may fruſtrate the Decrees of God, and make his preſcience falſe. Firſt, for the Decrees of God, This is his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that man ſhould be a free Agent; If he did conſider God, as a moſt ſimple Act without
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169972:127"/> priority or poſteriority of time, or any compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, He would not conceive of his Decrees, as of the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> long ſince enacted, and paſſed before we were born, but as coexiſtent with our ſelves, and with the acts which we do, by vertue of thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Decrees and Attributes are but notions to help the weakneſs of our underſtanding to conceive of God. The Decrees of God, are God himſelf, and therefore juſtly ſaid to be before the foundation of the world was laid. And yet coexiſtent with our ſelves, becauſe of the Infinite and Eternall being of God. The ſumme is this, The Decree of God, or God himſelf Eternally conſtitutes or ordaines all effects which come to to paſs in time, according to the diſtinct natures or capacities of his creatures. An Eternall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is neither paſt nor to come, but alwaies preſent. So free actions do proceed, as well from the Eternall Decree of God as neceſſary, and from that order which he hath ſet in the world.</p>
               <p>As the Decree of God is Eternall, ſo is his Knowledge. And therefore to ſpeak truly and properly, there is neither fore-knowledge nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-knowledge in him. The Knowledge of God comprehends all times in a point by reaſon of the eminence &amp; vertue of its infinite perfection. And yet I confeſs, that this is called fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in reſpect of us. But this fore-knowledge doth produce no abſolute neceſſity. Things are not therefore, becauſe they are fore-known, but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169972:127"/> therfore they are fore-known, becauſe they ſhall come to paſs. If any thing ſhould come to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than it doth, yet Gods knowledge could not be irritated by it, for then he did not know that it ſhould come to paſs, as now it doth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every knowledge of viſion neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth its object. God did know, that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray Chriſt; but <hi>Judas</hi> was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to be a traitor by Gods knowledge. If <hi>Judas</hi> had not betrayed Chriſt, then God had not fore-known that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray him. The caſe is this; A watch-man ſtanding on the ſteeples-top, as it is the uſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> gives notice to them below (who ſee no ſuch things) that company are coming, and how many; His prediction is moſt certain, for he ſees them. What a vain collection were it for one below to ſay, what if they do not come, then a certaine predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may fail. It may be urged, that there is a difference between theſe two caſes. In this caſe the coming is preſent to the Watch-man, but that which God fore-knowes is future. God knowes what ſhall be; The Watch-man onely knowes what is. I anſwer, that this makes no difference at all in the caſe, by reaſon of that diſparity which is between Gods knowledge and ours: As that coming is preſent to the Watchman, which is future to them who are below: So all thoſe things, which are future to us, are preſent to God, becauſe his Infinite and Eternall knowledge, doth reach to the future being of all Agents and events. Thus much is
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169972:128"/> plainly acknowledged by <hi>T. H.</hi> Numb. 11. That <hi>fore-knowledge is knowledge, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge depends on the exiſtence of the things known, and not they on it.</hi> To conclude, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God doth not make things more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, than the production of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; But if the Agents were free Agents, the production of the things doth not make the events to be abſolutely neceſſary, but onely upon ſuppoſition that the cauſes were ſo determined. Gods preſcience prooveth a neceſſity of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but not of antecedent extrinſecall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to one. If any event ſhould not come to paſs, God did never foreknow, that it would come to paſs. For every knowledge neceſſarily preſuppoſeth its object.</p>

If he had deſired to have kept it ſecret, the way had been to have kept it ſecret himſelf. It will not ſuffice to ſay as Numb. 14. that <hi>Truth is Truth;</hi> This the common plea of all men. Neither is it ſufficient for him to ſay, as Numb. 15. That <hi>it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by me,</hi> long before that he had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his opinion by word of mouth. And my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was to let ſome of my noble friends ſee the weakneſs of his grounds, and the pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of that opinion. But if he think that this ventilation of the queſtion between us two may do hurt, truly I hope not. The edge of his diſcourſe is ſo abated; that it cannot eaſily hurt any rationall man, who is not too much poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with prejudice.</p>

                  <hi>POſtſcript, Arguments ſeldom work on men of wit and learning, when they have once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves in a contrary opinion. If any thing do it, it is the ſhewing of them the cauſes of their errours, which is this; Pious men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to God Almighty for honour ſake, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſee is honourable in the world, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, willing, knowing, Juſtice, Wiſedom, &amp;c. But deny him ſuch poor things as eyes, ears, brains, and other organs, without which, we wormes, neither have, nor can conceive ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to be; and ſo far they do well. But when they diſpute of Gods actions Philoſophically, then they conſider them again, as if he had ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and in that manner, as we have them, this is not well, and thence it is they fall into ſo many difficulties. We ought not to diſpute of Gods Nature, he is no fit ſubject of our Philoſophy, True Religion conſiſteth in obedience to Chriſt's Lieutenants, and in giving God ſuch honour, both in attributes and actions, as they in their ſeverall Lieutenancies ſhall ordain.</hi>

                  <label>J. D.</label> THough Sophiſticall captions do ſeldom work <hi>on men of wit and learning,</hi> becauſe <hi>by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe they have their ſenſes exerciſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern both good and evill,</hi> Heb. 5.14. Yet ſolide
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169972:129"/> and ſubſtantiall reaſons work ſooner upon them than upon weaker judgments. The more exact the balance is, the ſooner it diſcovers the reall weight, that is put into it. Eſpecially if the proofs be propoſed without paſſion or oppoſition. Let Sophiſters and ſeditious Oratours apply themſelves to the many headed multitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſpaire of ſucceſs with <hi>men of wit and learning.</hi> Thoſe whoſe gold is true, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to have it tryed by the touch. Since the former way hath not ſucceeded, <hi>T. H.</hi> hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to ſhew, as the cauſes of our errours, which he hopes will proove more ſuccesfull. When he ſees he can do no good by ſight, he ſeeks to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent us, under colour of curteſy, <hi>Fiſtula dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce canit volucrem dum decipit auceps.</hi> As they, who behold themſelves in a glaſs, take the right hand for the left, and the left for the right, (T. H. knowes the compariſon) ſo we take our own errours to be truths, and other mens truths to be errours. If we be in an errour in this, it is ſuch an errour as we ſucked from nature it ſelf, ſuch an errour as is confirmed in us by reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſuch an errour as God himſelf in his ſacred Word hath revealed, ſuch an errour as the Fathers and Doctors of the Church of all ages have delivered, Such an errour wherein we have the concurrence of all the beſt Philoſophers, both Natural and Moral, ſuch an errour as brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to God, the glory of Juſtice and Wiſedom &amp; Goodneſs, and Truth, ſuch an errour as renders men more devout, more pious, more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169972:130"/> more humble, more penitent for their ſins. Would he have us reſign up all theſe advantages to dance blindfold after his pipe. No, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades us too much to our loſs. But let us ſee what is the imaginary cauſe of an imaginary er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Forſooth, becauſe we attribute to God whatſoever is honourable in the world, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, willing, knowing, Juſtice Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but deny him ſuch poor things, as eyes, ears, brains, and ſo far he ſaith we do well. He hath reaſon, for ſince we are not able to conceive of God as he is, the readieſt way we have, is by remooving all that imperfection from God, which is in the creatures. So we call him Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Immortall, Independent. Or by attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to him all thoſe perfections, which are in the creatures after a moſt eminent manner, ſo we call him Beſt, Greateſt, moſt Wiſe, moſt Juſt, moſt Holy. But ſaith he, <hi>When they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Gods actions Philoſophically, then they conſider them again, as if he had ſuch faculties, and in the manner as we have them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is this the cauſe of our errour? That were ſtrange indeed, for they who diſpute Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically of God, do neither aſcribe faculties to to him in that manner that we have them, Nor yet do they attribute any proper faculties at all to God. Gods Underſtanding, and his Will is his very Eſſence, which for the eminency of its infinite perfection, doth perform all thoſe things alone, in a moſt tranſcendent manner, which reaſonable creatures do perform imperfectly,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169972:130"/> by diſtinct faculties. Thus to diſpute of God with modeſty, and reverence, and to clear the Deity from the imputation of tyranny, in juſtice, and diſſimulation, which none do throw upon God with more preſumption, than thoſe who are the Patrons of abſolute neceſſity, is both comely and Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>It is not the deſire to diſcover the originall of a ſuppoſed errour, which drawes them ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into theſe exclamations, againſt thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the Deity. For ſome of themſelves dare anatomiſe God, and publiſh his Eternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees with as much confidence, as if they had been all their lives of his cabinet councell. But it is for fear, leſt thoſe pernicious conſequences, which flow from that doctrine eſſentially, and reflect in ſo high a degree upon the ſupreme goodneſs, ſhould be laid open to the view of the world; Juſt as the Turks do, firſt eſtabliſh a falſe religion of their own deviſing, and then forbid all men upon pain of death to diſpute upon religion; Or as the Prieſts of <hi>Molech</hi> (the Abhomination of the Ammonites) did, make a noiſe with their timbrells all the while the poor Infants were paſſing through the fire in <hi>Tophet,</hi> to keep their pitifull cries from the eares of their Parents: So they make a noiſe with their declamations againſt thoſe, who dare diſpute of the nature of God, that is, who dare ſet forth his Juſtice, and his goodneſs, and his truth, and his Philanthropy, onely to deaf the ears, and dim the eyes of the Chriſtian world,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169972:131"/> leaſt they ſhould hear the lamentable ejulations and howlings, or ſee, that ruefull ſpectacle of millions of ſouls tormented for evermore in the flames of the true <hi>Tophet,</hi> that is Hell, onely for that which according to <hi>T. H.</hi> his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was never in their power to ſhun, but which they were ordered and inevitably neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to do. Onely to expreſs the omnipotence and dominion, and to ſatisfie the pleaſure of him, who is in truth the <hi>Father of all mercies, and the God of all conſolation.</hi> This is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall (ſaith our Saviour) to know the <hi>onely true God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom he hath ſent. Joh. 17.3. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled before God, and the Father, is this, to viſite the fatherleſs and widowes in their affliction, and to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unſpotted from the world,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. James,</hi> Jam. 1.27. <hi>Fear God and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this is the whole duty of man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. But T. H. hath found out a more compendious way to heaven: <hi>True Religion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>conſiſteth in obedience to Chriſts Lieutenants, and giving God ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both in attributes and actions, as they in their ſeverall Lieutenances ſhall ordain.</hi> That is to ſay, be of the Religion of every Chriſtian Country where you come. To make the Civill Magiſtrate to be Chriſts Lieutenant upon earth, for matters of Religion; And to make him to be Supreme Judge in all controverſies, whom all muſt obey, is a doctrine ſo ſtrange, and ſuch an uncouth phraſe to Chriſtian eares, that I ſhould
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:169972:131"/> have miſſed his meaning, but that I conſulted with his Book, <hi>De Cive c.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. and <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 28. What if the Magiſtrate ſhall be no Chriſtian himſelf? What if he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contrary to the Law of God, or Nature, <hi>Muſt we obey him rather than God?</hi> Act. 14.19: Is the Civill Magiſtrate become now the onely <hi>ground and pillar of Truth?</hi> I demand then why <hi>T. H.</hi> is of a different mind from his ſoveraign, and from the Lawes of the Land concerning the attributes of God and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees? This is a new Paradox, and concerns not this queſtion of liberty, and neceſſity? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forbear to proſecute it further, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my reply with the words of the Chriſtian Poet,
